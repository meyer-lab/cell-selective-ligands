## Abstract {.page_break_before}

A critical property of many therapies is their selective binding to specific target populations. Exceptional specificity can arise from high-affinity binding to unique cell surface targets. In many cases, however, therapeutic targets are not uniquely expressed, or are only expressed at different levels relative to off-target cells. More complex binding strategies have been designed to overcome these limitations, including multi-specific molecules, yet these create a combinatorial explosion of design possibilities. Therefore, guiding strategies for developing cell-specific binding are critical to employ these tools. Here, we extend a multi-valent binding model to multi-ligand and multi-receptor interactions. Using this model, we identify a series of mechanisms to engineer cell selectivity, including mixtures of molecules, affinity adjustments, and valency changes. Each of these strategies maximize selectivity in distinct cases, leading to further improvements when used in combination. Finally, we identify situations in which selectivity cannot be derived through binding alone to highlight potential areas of exploring new mechanisms. In total, this work provides design guidelines for engineering cell-specific therapies.

## Summary points

- Affinity, valency, and other alterations to target cell binding only provide enganced selectivity in specific situations.
- Evidence for the effectiveness and limitations of each strategy are abundant within the drug development literature.
- Combining strategies can offer enhanced selectivity.
- A simple, multivalent antigen-receptor binding model can help to direct therapeutic engineering.
