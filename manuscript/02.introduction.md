## Introduction

<!-- Targeting specific cell populations is a universal challenge in protein therapies. -->

Many drugs derive their therapeutic benefit, and avoid toxicity, through selective binding to specific cells within the body. However, even with a drug of very specific molecular binding, genetic and non-genetic heterogeneity can create a wide distribution of cell responses. This can result in reduced effectiveness and toxicity. For example, in cancer, resistance to anti-tumor antibodies [@doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1735], targeted inhibitors [@pmid:20129249], chemotherapies [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.03.025], and chimeric antigen receptor T cells [@doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1407222; @doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa0984] all can arise through the selection of cells within a heterogeneous population. Indeed, the immune system takes advantage of heterogeneity at the single-cell level to translate noisy inflammatory signals into robust yet sensitive responses [@PMID:24919153]. Even in the absence of heterogeneity, target cells can differ from off-target populations only by subtle changes in surface receptor expression. These challenges limit the selectivity of therapies within the body.

<!-- Need alternative strategies for engineering specificity. -->

Further improving cell-specific targeting will require new strategies of engineering specificity. Protein therapies have most extensively been engineered to target specific cell types through mutations that provide high-affinity binding to unique surface antigens [@pmid:25992859]. This strategy can enhance specificity, but only to a limited degree, particularly when target cells can only be distinguished by subtle quantitative differences in surface antigen or by combinations of markers. The limitations of single-antigen targeting have led to efforts to engineer logic and more complex programs into cellular therapies to recognize target cells more specifically [@doi:10.1126/science.aay2790; @pmid:30889382; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.038]. However, protein and other non-cellular therapies have considerable benefits in drug access, manufacturing, and reliability; some of the same benefits have begun to be engineered into these agents.

<!-- We need computational models to make sense of this. -->
The enormous number of potential configurations make computational tools essential for designing highly selective therapies [@doi:10.1101/812131]. Here, we analyze a suite of molecular strategies for engineering cell-specific binding using a multi-valent, multi-receptor, multi-ligand model. We show that strategies including affinity, valency, binding competition, ligand mixtures, and hetero-valent complexes provide distinct and non-overlapping improvements in cell-specific targeting. With each strategy, we highlight evidence of its effect in existing therapeutic agents. Finally, we combine these strategies to target cells through combinatorial strategies. In total, our results demonstrate that binding programs can offer combinatorial targeting strategies with similar effectiveness as complex engineered cellular therapies and can be engineered using a mechanistic binding model.
