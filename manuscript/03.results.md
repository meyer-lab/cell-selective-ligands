Here we investigate cell-specific targeting quantitatively by extending an equilibrium, multi-valent, multi-ligand binding model. Virtually any therapy, including monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, and cytokines, can be thought of as ligands for respective receptors expressed on target cells. Ligand binding to target cells is the first step and essential for a drug's intended action; in contrast, binding to off-target cells can result in unintended effects or toxicity. Some cell populations can be distinguished by unique receptor expression, but more commonly target and off-target cells express the same collection of receptors and differ only in their amounts. In such situations, engineering drugs optimized to achieve more ligand bound to the target cells, while minimizing the binding to off-target cells, is an area of ongoing research and has inspired myriad drug design strategies [@doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6604700; @doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7]. We will use a quantitative binding estimation for these two cell populations to examine these strategies.

While ligand-receptor binding events in biology are diverse, they are governed by their thermodynamic properties and the law of mass action. When a reaction reaches its equilibrium state, the ratio of the product of the concentrations of each, $[L][R]$, to the concentration of monomeric ligand-receptor complex, $[LR]$, can be defined as a dissociation constant $K_D$. The number of ligands in the solution is often much greater than that of the receptors so that binding does not deplete the ligand concentration. Binding behavior is more complex when the ligands are multivalent complexes consisting of multiple units, each of which can bind to a receptor (Fig. {@fig:model}a). During initial association, we will assume that the first subunit on a ligand complex binds according to the same dynamics that govern monovalent binding. Subsequent binding events exhibit different behavior, however, due to the increased local concentration of the complex. Here, we assume that the effective dissociation constant for the subsequent bindings is proportional to that of the free binding, but scaled by a constant, $K_x^*$, due to its different local concentration and steric effects. Another consideration that must be made when modeling multivalent binding processes is whether a ligand complex is formed by a random assortment of monomer units or by engineering to produce complexes of defined uniform composition. We developed a multivalent binding model that calculates the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium taking each of these factors into account (see methods).

As a simplification, we will consider theoretical cell populations that express only two receptors capable of binding ligand (Fig. {@fig:model}b), ranging in abundance from 100 to 10,000 per cell. Figure {@fig:model}c shows the log-scaled predicted amount of binding of a monovalent ligand given the abundance of two receptors. Because all axes are log-scaled the number of contour lines between two points indicates the ratio of ligand binding between populations. For instance, in figure {@fig:model}c, cell populations at points 1 and 2 are on the same contour line and thus have the same amount of ligand bound; the cell populations at points 1 and 3 have multiple contour lines between and so point 3 has more ligand binding. (In fact, the ratio can be read as the exponent of the contour line difference. For point 3 to point 1, the ratio is $e ^{4.6-2.3} \approx 7.4$.)

As an example, we chose the concentration of ligand, $L_0$, to be $1 \mathrm{nM}$, and the dissociation constants to the two receptors to be $10^4 nM$ and $10^2 nM$, respectively. Figure {@fig:model}c shows that when the amount of $R_1$ increases on a cell (a point moves rightward, e.g. from 1 to 2), the amount of binding doesn’t increase significantly. On the contrary, adding more $R_2$ (moving upward, e.g. from 1 to 3) will lead to a great boost on ligand bound. The high affinity of $R_2$ leads to a greater binding dependence on the expression of $R_2$ than $R_1$. This situation corresponds to some cue inducing expression of a receptor (e.g. interferon-induced upregulation of MHC, or regulatory T cell upregulation of IL-2R⍺ [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.0812851107]).

To analyze more general cases, we defined eight theoretical cell populations according to their differential expression of two receptor types ($R_1$ and $R_2$ plotted on x and y axes). As shown in Fig {@fig:model}d, they either have high ($10^4$), medium ($10^3$), or low ($10^2$) expression of $R_1$ and $R_2$. To account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity, we also defined intrapopulation variability. For instance, the expression profile of $R_1^{med} R_2^{med}$ has a wider range. We will use this binding model to examine how engineering on affinity, valency, and hetero-valent complexes improve cell-specific targeting. Although we will only consider two receptor and ligand subunit types, respectively, the principles we present generalize to more complex cases.

### Affinity Provides Selectivity Toward Cell Populations with Divergent Receptor Expression

![**Affinity provides selectivity to cell populations with divergent receptor expression.** a) Heat/contour maps of monovalent ligand binding to cell populations given the surface abundance of two receptors. Ligand dissociation constants to these receptors range from $10^{4} \sim 10^{2} nM$. Ligand concentration $L_0=1 \mathrm{nM}$; crosslinking constant $K_x^*=10^{-10}$. b-e) Heatmap of binding ratio of cell populations exposed to a monovalent ligand with dissociation constants to receptor 1 and 2 ranging from $10^{4} \sim 10^{2} nM$, at a concentration of $10 \mathrm{nM}$. b–e) Ligand bound ratio of (b) $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$, (c) $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$, (d) $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, and (e) $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$.](figure2.svg){#fig:affinity}

When a target cell population expresses a unique receptor or pattern of receptors, enhancing the affinity to this receptor or reducing the affinity to other receptors are clear strategies to increase selective binding (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). As an example, cell type $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ expresses a high amount of receptor 1, while type $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ expresses receptor 2 at a higher abundance (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). Enhancing ligand affinity for receptor 1 and weakening its interaction with receptor 2 results in improved binding selectivity toward $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ over $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ (Fig. {@fig:affinity}e). Unsurprisingly, all cell populations with abundant receptor 1 bind greater amounts of ligand in this case. The contour plot on the background shows this trend more intuitively: when the affinity of receptor 1 increases (from the subplots on the left to those on the right), the contour lines shift inward and cluster more densely, indicating an enhanced sensitivity of binding to expression of receptor 1.

However, just as often, both on- and off-target cell populations express the same set of receptors and only differ in their magnitude of expression. An example of this pattern is $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). In this case, the benefit of affinity changes is limited to the relative difference in receptor amounts (Fig. {@fig:affinity}c). Thus, to use affinity changes for selectivity enhancement it is critical to identify which receptors a cell population of interest expresses most uniquely.

Cell populations are made up of individual cells with heterogeneous amounts of receptor. For example, $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ has relatively high variance (Fig. @fig:affinity). The ellipse representing its range of receptor abundances rides through multiple contour lines, indicating wide variation in the quantity of bound ligand. Thus, if we choose to maneuver the affinity of receptor 1 to attain more selective binding to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ over $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, we can expect greater intra-population variation in binding to the latter (Fig. @fig:affinity).

### Valency Enables Selectivity Based on Quantitative Differences in Receptor Abundance

Given the limitations of deriving selectivity from affinity changes we next explored the effect of valency changes (Fig. {@fig:valency}d). Multivalent ligand binding differs from monovalent binding in its non-linear relationship with cellular receptor density, allowing multivalent ligands to potentially selectively target cells based on receptor abundance [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. The effects of varying ligand valency are visualized in Fig. {@fig:valency}a-c. Here, the amount of ligand bound by cells expressing different abundances of receptor 1 and 2 is quantified. Ligand binds both receptors with equal affinity and the valency of the ligand is varied across subplots. The most notable effect of changing valency is observed as variable density of binding isoclines in the contour plot. For example, in the monovalent case, the relative levels of binding of $R_1^{lo}R_2^{lo}$, $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$,  and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, all of which have identical relative abundance of receptors 1 and 2, is exactly proportional to their receptor abundance. However, in the multivalent case, the density of contour isoclines varies as a function of receptor expression, causing the ligand binding difference between these populations to vary.

In order to further validate our model's capacity to predict multivalent binding activity, we fit it to data gathered by Csizmar et al., where the amount of multivalent, fluorescently labeled nanorings bound to populations expressing large amounts of fibronectin was measured [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. By using a least squares fitting to determine crosslinking coefficients, and receptor affinity values, our model was able to accurately predict the amount of nanorings with four or eight fibronectin binding domains bound to MCF-7 cells expressing a known abundance of fibronectin domains (Fig. {@fig:Csizmar}a).

Selectivity derived from valency engineering requires coordinate changes in affinity. Like we predict, lower affinity, multi-valent interactions have been shown to exhibit abundance selectivity for target cells [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. Comparing binding between cell populations exposed to ligands of variable affinities over a range of ligand valency demonstrates this interplay (Fig. {@fig:valency}b-d). Here, the ligand binding ratios between cell populations are shown for ligands of low, medium, and high affinities ($K_D$ of $10^3$, $10^2$, $10^1$ nM). For example, the ligand binding ratio between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ is maximized by low affinity ligands, but requires greater valency to achieve peak binding selectivity when compared to ligands of greater affinity (Fig. {@fig:valency}b). A similar valency optimum for a given affinity is seen for binding selectivity between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ (Fig. {@fig:valency}c-d). Ligands with lower affinities achieve optimal binding with higher valencies and exhibit higher selectivity than the high affinity ligands.

Our model allows us to identify the mechanism of valency-mediated receptor abundance selectivity by looking at the average number of receptors bound by each ligand complex. A cell expressing $10^4$ receptors displays similar amounts of binding at each valency for ligands with dissociation constants of $10^3$, $10^2$, and $10^1$ nM (Fig. {@fig:valency}e). However, a cell expressing a degree of magnitude fewer receptors exhibits extremely low amounts of multivalent binding for ligand complexes of low binding affinity (Fig. {@fig:valency}f). This effect arises due to a higher dissociation rate than multi-valent binding association rate at low receptor abundances (Fig. {@fig:valency}g). Multivalent ligands will undergo initial binding events at rates unaffected by receptor abundance, but low affinity and receptor density severely limit the possibility of secondary binding events. In contrast, cells with higher receptor abundance accumulate ligand binding by binding ligand at high valency, as the rate of multi-valent binding is greater than that of disassociation (Fig. {@fig:valency}f). This effect allows for valency to provide selectivity between cells having differences in receptor expression density, where affinity alone may fail.

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives a Limited Selectivity Enhancement of Mixtures

While most therapies rely on the action of a single molecular species, mixtures may enhance selectivity through combinations of actions [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1549]. Furthermore, some biologics inevitably end up as mixtures of species through heterogeneity in glycosylation [@DOI:10.1002/rcm.3330]. In these cases, it is important to understand how these species influence the overall response.

To evaluate the contribution of mixtures, we evaluated model-predicted binding while varying the composition between ligands with either receptor 1- or 2-preferred binding, respectively (Fig. {@fig:mixture}a). The trend that arises is very similar to an additive combination of the single ligand cases. This pattern highlights a key limitation of using mixtures for selectivity; selectivity is always maximized by using 100% of the more specific ligand, at least when defining selectivity between two populations (Fig. {@fig:mixture}b).

While mixture engineering fails to enhance binding selectivity between two cell populations, it is potentially effective when considering three or more off-target cell populations. More specifically, when a target population expresses two target receptors, but off-target populations express each receptor individually in high amounts, drug mixtures can offer enhanced selectivity. For example, when maximizing targeting to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ over $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, which individually express high levels of the receptors found on the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, we show that a uniform mixture of ligands with high affinity for receptor 1 and 2 provides a modest improvement in targeting selectivity (Fig. {@fig:mixture}c). We also demonstrate the utility of mixture engineering in two other target/off-target cell population combinations where multiple off-target populations are considered (Fig. {@fig:mixture}d/e). However, even in these cases, the magnitude of selectivity enhancement is modest. Finally, although we only consider the amount of binding, ligands can have non-overlapping signaling effects even with identical amounts of binding. In these cases, the effect of combinations can be distinct from either individual ligand [@pmid:28886385; @pmid:29960887].

### Heterovalent Bispecific Ligands Exhibit Unique Charateristics When Activated Fully Bound

Constructing multispecific drug has become a promising new strategy for finer target cell specificity with the advancement of engineering techniques [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2168-1]. Here, we use the bispecific ligand as an exemplar to dissect its advantages. Heterovalency is comparable to the two aforementioned strategies: it includes two distinct ligand monomers, similar to a 50%-50% mixture strategy, but these two subunits are tethered together; alternatively, it is also analogous to having a mixture of bivalent ligands. We applied the binding model to these cases with the same set of parameters and compared them in line to identify the unique advantage of heterovalency. These two monomers must have different binding profiles, otherwise it will be identical to the homogeneous bivalent case.

The amount of bispecific ligand bound in general is plotted in Figure @fig:bispecific a, while the ligand-bound of a 50%-50% mix of monovalent ligands in Figure @fig:bispecific b and 50%-50% mix of bivalent ligands in Figure @fig:bispecific c. Given the same parameter, the ligand-bounds of these three cases are almost exactly the same, and bispecific doesn’t exhibit any merit. When $K_x^*$ is relatively small, it is expected that most bindings are the initial docking of the ligand without subsequent binding. Nonetheless, in many heterovalent cases such as the bispecific antibody [@doi:10.1080/19420862.2015.1062192; @pmid:30145356], the drug will not be fully effective unless both subunits bind to targets. To scrutinize this case, we extended our model to calculate the amount of ligand fully bound. The predictions made for bispecific fully bound (with $K_x^* =10^{-12}$) plotted in Figure @fig:bispecific e show a different pattern than general ligand bound. Besides having a lower amount, fully bound ligand prefers double-positively expressed cells. This can be observed from the more concaved isoclines in Figure @fig:bispecific e compare with Figure @fig:bispecific a: in Figure @fig:bispecific e, $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ have about the same level of fully bound ligands. The bispecific also behaves differently from a 50%-50% mixture of homogeneous bivalent ligands when they fully bound, as plotted in Figure @fig:bispecific g. This indicates that bispecific ligand will provide unique enhancement only when the binding of both subunits is required.

The binding characteristics of fully bound bispecific opens up new opportunities for targeting specific cell populations. The specific amount of fully bound ligands depends on the tendency of crosslinking, captured by $K_x^*$, as shown in Figure @fig:bispecific d-f. In general, when $K_x^*$ is larger, the ligands are more capable of multimerization, and there will be more fully bound units. To recognize how the amount of fully bound bispecifics varies comparing with its untethered version (monovalent mixture) and the homogeneous bivalent case, we plotted Figure @fig:bispecific a normalized by @fig:bispecific b in @fig:bispecific h and by @fig:bispecific c in @fig:bispecific i. Compared with the monovalent mixture (Fig. @fig:bispecific h), fully bound bispecific clearly prefers doubly-positive cell populations, although in a non-linear fashion. This is verified by plotting the ratios of selectivities of various population pairs under tethered versus untethered condition in Figure @fig:bispecific k: when $K_x^*$ is small, bispecific fully bound better targets towards $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ , but doesn’t help separating $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ from $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$. Compared with the bivalent mixture, bispecific fully bound prefers a narrow range of cell population with a certain receptor expression profile, as shown in Figure @fig:bispecific i as the “dark belt”. The position of this dark belt may be dependent on the choices of ligand affinities. $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ sits in this “belt”, thus preferred by the bispecifics. This is also corroborated by Figure @fig:bispecific l, the ratios of selectivities between bivalent mixture and bispecifics, where the green line illustrating the $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ ratio shoots up with decreasing $K_x^*$.

### Combining Strategies For Superior Selectivity

Example: [@pmid:30145356]

While each therapeutic design methodology discussed in this work can drive superior cell-type selectivity in certain situations, the advantages of intersecting these design strategies has yet to be thoroughly explored. Combining ligand design features such as affinity modulation, increasing valency, and mixing therapeutics offers a potential route for synergistically combining the effects offered by each. We explored these potential synergies using a quasi-newton optimizer to determine the optimally cell-type selective ligand for our theoretical cell populations.

It is often the case that target cell populations express receptors common to a range of adjacent, off-target populations. Thus, we sought to determine the optimal ligand for particular cell populations while considering all other theoretical populations to exist as off-target cells. By optimizing within bounds that restricted all ligand modulations, we set our initial binding selectivity performance metric (Fig. @fig:combination). To simulate the effects that affinity engineering could impart on selectivity, we then allowed ligand-receptor affinities to be varied. To understand the effects of valency and mixture engineering on selectivity, we allowed ligand valency and mixtures to vary, while also allowing affinity to vary due to the previously noted reliance that these strategies have on receptor-ligand kinetics. Finally, all ligand parameters were allowed to vary to simulate the effects of combining therapeutic engineering approaches.

Optimizing a ligand for selectivity to $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ highlights a situation in which combined affinity and valency individually impart greater specificity, and optimal selectivity is achieved by synergistically combining these two strategies (Fig. {@fig:combination}a-f). Here selectivity is optimized by ligands with selective binding to receptor 2, and those with valencies allowing for selective binding to cells with higher abundances of receptor expression. Here, and in many cases, a dominant therapeutic design strategy emerges without consideration of all possible engineering avenues. One case contradictory to this trend is shown during the optimization for selectivity towards the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ . While affinity, valency, and mixture engineering are able to impart some small contributions to enhanced selectivity, significant improvement is only achieved when combining all aforementioned strategies (Fig. {@fig:combination}g-l). Here, synergistic combination of strategies can be employed to great effect, granting far superior ligand selectivity. A more difficult design problem is featured in the optimization of $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, which lies in the midst of the other populations in receptor expression space (Fig. {@fig:mixture}m-r). Here, solely allowing for modulation of affinity, or combining it with mixture-based strategies is ineffective. Only with the introduction of valency modulation is selectivity significantly enhanced. However, an alternative approach to targeting $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ is presented in Fig. {@fig:combination}s-v. Here the population is exposed to a mixture of an octovalent "dead" ligand which can bind receptors 1 and 2 but is assumed to not induce signaling response and a therapeutic monovalent ligand with optimized affinities. Results are normalized to the selectivity imparted when the dead ligand is non-binding (Fig. {@fig:combination}s). We see here that enhanced selectivity can be achieved by these means, as the dead ligand blocks many of the available receptors on populations expressing higher abundances (Fig. {@fig:mixture}u).

Our results highlight that both in singular and combined strategies for therapeutic manipulation, the target and off-target populations dictate the optimal approach. It is also clear that combined approaches do offer synergies which can be harnessed, but that those are only emergent in particular therapeutic situations.

### Exploiting Combinations of Receptor Agonists and Antagonists for Enhanced Selectivity

While the situational benefits of ligand affinity modulation, valency engineering, and mixing of therapeutic ligands have been explored singularly and in combination, there remain some target and off-target populations which remain difficult to impart selectivity to. For example, achieving binding selectivity for target populations expressing moderate amounts of receptors compared to off-target populations remains challenging (Fig. {@fig:combination}m-r). Here, we explore the utility of receptor antagonists for the blocking of off-target populations' receptors.

Mixtures of receptor agonists and antagonists are dependent both on the affinity and valency structure of antagonistic ligand. We explore the benefits to selectivity imparted by a tetravalent antagonist (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}). Here, it is shown that selectivity for $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ against all other populations using a monovalent ligand can be improved by combining the therapeutic with a tetravalent antagonist with similar affinities for receptor one and two (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}a). The mechanism which is responsible for this, and which allows for combinations of monovalent agonistic ligands and multivalent antogonistic ligands to uniquely target populations expressing small or intermediate amounts of recepotrs is demonstrated when comparing ligand binding ratios between $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}e). Here, a nearly ten fold increase in selectivity can be granted to monovalent agonists when combined with a tetravalent antagonist. In this case, there are greater quantities of agonist bound to $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ than $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}f). This is striking, as $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ expresses either as many or fewer abundances of receptors one and two when compared to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$. This phenomenon, which could not be achieved without multivalent antagonists, occurs due to the preferential binding of multivalent antagonists to populations expressing higher abundances of receptors (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}c,g). Thus, in cases where previously discussed ligand engineering strategies and approaches fail to achieve selective binding to cells expressing smaller or similar amounts of receptors to off-target populations, combinations of agonistic and antagonistic ligands may provide unique benefits.
