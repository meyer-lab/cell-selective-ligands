### A Model System to Explore the Factors Contributing to Cell Selectivity

![**A model system for exploring the factors contributing to cell selectivity.** a) A simplified schematic of the binding model. There are two types of receptors and two types of ligand monomers that form a tetravalent complex. The two ligands (represented by red squares and green circles), initially interact with the surface receptors (blue and orange) with various association constants ($K_{a,1}$, $K_{a,2}$, $K_{a,3}$, and $K_{a,4}$). b) A cartoon for four cell populations expressing two different receptors at low or high amounts. c) A sample heat/contour map for the model-predicted log ligand bound given the expression of two types of receptors. d) Eight arbitrary theoretical cell populations with various receptor expression profiles.](figure1.svg){#fig:model}

### Quantitative Model Brings Insights to Existing Selectivity Engineering Strategies



### Heterovalent Bispecific Ligands Exhibit Unique Characteristics When Activated Fully Bound

![**Bispecific ligands exhibit unique effects when they can only be activated with both subunits bind.** a-c) Ordinary ligand bound are dominated by the initial binding of ligands, so it doesn't provide unique advantages to a) bispecific ligand comparing with b) a 50%-50% mixture of monovalent ligands and c) a 50%-50% mixture of bivalent ligands. Ligand concentration $L_0=10 \mathrm{nM}$; binding affinities $K_{d11}=100 \mathrm{nM}, K_{d22}=1 \mathrm{\mu M}, K_{d12}=K_{d21}=10 \mathrm{\mu M}$. d-f) The amount of fully bound bispecific ligands depends on the tendency of multimerization, capsuled by $K_x^*$. d) $K_x^* =10^{-10}$, e) $K_x^* =10^{-12}$, f) $K_x^* =10^{-14}$. g,h) Comparing bispecific selectivities with mixture selectivities, varies with $K_x^*$, the crosslinking constant. When the ratios are larger, bispecific ligands bind to target populations more specifically. g) bispecific selectivities divided by monovalent 50%-50% mixture selectivities, h) bispecific selectivities divided by a 50%-50% homo-bivalent mixture selectivities. i) Cartoons of bispecific ligands and ligand fully bound binding model.](figure3.svg){#fig:bispecific}

### Using Binding Competition to Invert Receptor Targeting

![**Mixtures of receptor agonists and antagonists allow for unique population targeting activity.** Ligand concentration $L_0=1 \mathrm{nM}$. a) Selectivity for $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ against $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ when exposed to a tetravalent "dead ligand" antagonist with varying affinities for receptors 1 and 2, and a monovalent therapeutic receptor agonists with affinities optimized for selectivity. Only amount of agonist bound is considered in determination of optimal selectivity. b-d) Heatmap of agonist (b), and antagonist (c) ligand bound for antagonist and agonist ligand combination shown to impart greatest selectivity improvement in (a). d) Heatmap of agonist bound in b,c when no antagonist is present.](figureS4.svg){#fig:deadLig}

### Combining Strategies For Superior Selectivity

![**Combinations of strategies provide superior selectivity.** a,g,m) Optimal selectivity levels (ligand bound on target population divided by average ligand bound by all other populations) achieved using various ligand engineering techniques. Ligand concentration $L_0=1 \mathrm{nM}$. "Unoptimized" ligands are monovalent ligands with affinities of $1 \,\mathrm{\mu M}$ for both receptor 1 and 2. The dissociation constant was allowed to vary between $10 \,\mathrm{mM}$ and $0.1 \,\mathrm{nM}$ for both receptors using the "affinity" approach. Valency was allowed to vary from 1 to 16 for the "valency" approach in addition to affinities varying. Mixtures were assumed to be composed of two monovalent ligands, and affinities were allowed to vary in the "mixture" approach. The combined "all" approach allowed all of these quantities to vary simultaneously. The crosslinking constant $K_x^*$ was allowed to vary between $10^{-15}$ and $10^{-9}$ for all approaches. b-f,h-l,n-f) Heatmap of magnitude of ligand bound for ligand with optimized characteristics according to various ligand engineering strategies. Target population is shown in red. a-f) Pertains to optimal targeting of $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, g-l) pertains to optimal targeting of $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, and m-r) pertains to optimal targeting of $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$.](figureS5.svg){#fig:combination}
