Here we investigate cell-specific targeting quantitatively by extending a multi-valent, multi-ligand equilibrium binding model. Virtually any therapy, including monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, and cytokines, can be thought of as ligands for respective receptors expressed on target cells. Ligand binding to target cells is the first step and essential for a drug's intended action; in contrast, binding to off-target cells can result in unintended effects or toxicity. Some cell populations can be distinguished by unique receptor expression, but more commonly target and off-target cells express the same collection of receptors and differ only in their amounts. In such situations, engineering drugs optimized to achieve more ligand bound to the target cells while minimizing the binding to off-target cells, is an area of ongoing research and has inspired myriad drug design strategies [@doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6604700; @doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7]. In this work, we define cell population selectivity as the ratio of the number of ligands bound to target cell populations over the number of ligands bound to off-target cell populations. We will use a quantitative binding estimation for each cell population to examine these strategies.

While ligand-receptor binding events in biology are diverse, they are governed by thermodynamic properties and the law of mass action. When a reaction reaches its equilibrium state, the ratio of the concentration of monomeric ligand-receptor complex, $[LR]$, to the product of the concentrations of each, $[L][R]$, can be defined as an association constant $K_a$, and its reciprocal is defined as the dissociation constant $K_d$. The number of ligands in the solution is usually much greater than that of the receptors, so we assume binding does not deplete the ligand concentration. Binding behavior is more complex when the ligands are multivalent complexes consisting of multiple units, each of which can bind to a receptor (Fig. {@fig:model}a). During initial association, we assume that the first subunit on a ligand complex binds according to the same dynamics that govern monovalent binding. Subsequent binding events exhibit different behavior, however, due to the increased local concentration of the complex and steric effects. Here, we assume that the effective association constant for the subsequent bindings is proportional to that of the free binding, but scaled by a constant, $K_x^*$. Another consideration that must be made when modeling multivalent binding processes is whether a ligand complex is formed by a random assortment of monomer units or by engineering to produce complexes of defined uniform composition. We developed a multivalent binding model that calculates the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium taking each of these factors into account (see methods).

As a simplification, we will consider theoretical cell populations that express only two receptors capable of binding ligand (Fig. {@fig:model}b), ranging in abundance from 100 to 10,000 per cell. Figure {@fig:model}c shows the log-scaled predicted amount of binding of a monovalent ligand given the abundance of two receptors, with the concentration of ligand, $L_0$, to be $1 \mathrm{nM}$, and its dissociation constants to the two receptors to be $10 \mathrm{\mu M}$ and $100$ $\mathrm{nM}$, respectively. Because all axes are log-scaled, the number of contour lines between two points indicates the ratio of ligand binding between populations. For instance, in figure {@fig:model}c, cell populations at points 1 and 2 are on the same contour line and thus have the same amount of ligand bound; the cell populations at points 1 and 3 have multiple contour lines between and so point 3 has more ligand binding (In fact, the ratio can be read as the exponent of the contour line difference. For point 3 to point 1, the ratio is $e ^{4.6-2.3} \approx 7.4$). Alternatively, we can think of moving from one point to another as a change of expression profile for a cell population. When the amount of $R_1$ increases on a cell (a point moves rightward, e.g. from 1 to 2), the amount of binding doesn’t increase significantly. On the contrary, adding more $R_2$ (moving upward, e.g. from 1 to 3) will lead to a great boost on ligand bound. The high affinity of $R_2$ leads to a greater binding sensitivity on the expression of $R_2$ than $R_1$. This situation might correspond to some cue inducing expression of a receptor, such as interferon-induced upregulation of MHC and regulatory T cell upregulation of IL-2R⍺ [@DOI:10.1073/pnas.0812851107].

To analyze more general cases, we defined eight theoretical cell populations according to their differential expression of two receptor types ($R_1$ and $R_2$ plotted on x and y axes). As shown in Fig {@fig:model}d, they either have high ($10^4$), medium ($10^3$), or low ($10^2$) expression of $R_1$ and $R_2$. To account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity, we also defined intrapopulation variability. For instance, the expression profile of $R_1^{med} R_2^{med}$ has a wider range. We will use this binding model to examine how engineering using affinity, valency, and hetero-valent complexes improve cell-specific targeting. Although we will only consider two receptor and ligand subunit types respectively, the principles we present can generalize to more complex cases.

### Affinity Provides Selectivity Toward Cell Populations with Divergent Receptor Expression

We first explored altering the affinities of a ligand to the receptors as an engineering strategy to enhance its cell population specificity. Here, we showed the binding pattern of monovalent ligands with various affinities ranging from $10000 \mathrm{nM}$ to $100 \mathrm{nM}$ to the two receptors $R_1$ and $R_2$ (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). When a target cell population expresses a receptor uniquely higher than other populations, enhancing the affinity of the drug to this receptor is a clear strategy to increase selective binding to this population. For example, $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ only expresses a high amount of $R_1$, while $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ only expresses a high amount of $R_2$. When the affinity to $R_1$ is enhanced and the affinity to $R_2$ is reduced, the binding selectivity towards $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ increases (Fig. {@fig:affinity}b). The contour plots in Fig. {@fig:affinity}a shows this trend more intuitively: when the affinity of $R_1$ increases, which corresponds to shifting from the left subplots to the right ones, the contour lines of higher values shift inward and cluster more densely, indicating an increase in the amount of ligand bound for the populations with high $R_1$ expression, such as $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$.

However, it is quite often that both on- and off-target cell populations express the same set of receptors and only differ in their magnitude of expression. In these cases, we found out that it is beneficial for the drug to bind tightly to the most comparatively highly expressed receptor on the target population. Some examples of this pattern are the selective binding to $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ over $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ over $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). For these two pairs, the benefit of affinity changes is limited to the relative discrepancy in receptor amounts (Fig. {@fig:affinity}c,d). Since the more highly expressed receptors have only 10-fold difference comparing with the 100-fold difference in $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ over $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, the greatest binding ratios these two pairs can achieve are no more than 10 times instead of 50 times. When both receptors are uniformally more abundant in a target population than the off target population, such as when comparing $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, affinity tuning doesn't change selective binding (Fig. {@fig:affinity}d). Therefore, to use affinity changes for selectivity enhancement, it is critical to identify which receptors a cell population of interest expresses the most uniquely.

Through reading the contour plots, we can also ponder how affinity changes affect the intrapopulation heterogeneity. For example, $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ has relatively high variance in both $R_1$ and $R_2$ expression (Fig. @fig:affinity a). When the binding affinities to $R_1$ and $R_2$ are divergent, such as shown in the subplots in the upper left corner and bottom right corner of Figure @fig:affinity a, the ellipse representing its range of receptor abundances rides through multiple contour lines, indicating wide variation in the quantity of bound ligand. This intrapopulation variation in the amount of ligand bound, however, is not observed when the affinities to $R_1$ and $R_2$ are more balanced. When designing a therapeutic for cell populations with broader or more dynamic expression profile, such as tumor cells, the consideration in intrapopulation heterogeneity when using affinity engineering is worthwhile.

### Valency Enables Selectivity Based on Quantitative Differences in Receptor Abundance

Given the limitations of deriving selectivity from affinity changes, we next explored the effect of valency changes (Fig. {@fig:valency}). Multivalent ligand binding differs from monovalent binding in its non-linear relationship with cellular receptor density, allowing multivalent ligands to potentially selectively target cells based on receptor abundance [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. The effects of varying ligand valency are visualized in Fig. {@fig:valency}a. Here, the amount of ligand bound by cells expressing different abundances of receptor $R_1$ and $R_2$ is quantified. The ligand only binds to receptor $R_1$ and the valency of the ligand is varied across subplots. The most notable effect of changing valency is observed as variable density of lines in the binding contour plot. For example, in the monovalent case, there are roughly the same amount of contour lines between $ R_1^{lo}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ and between $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$  and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, but in the tetravalent case, there are more contour lines between $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$  and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, suggesting a sharper increase in ligand bound (Fig. {@fig:valency}a).

Previous work has shown that our binding model can accurately predict the complicated multivalent binding process between IgG antibodies and Fcγ receptors [@pmid:29960887]. To further demonstrate our model's capacity to predict multivalent binding activity, we fit our model to previous experimental measurements wherein fluorescently labeled nanorings were assembled with specific numbers of binding units [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. After fitting to determine the crosslinking coefficient and receptor affinity values, our model was able to accurately match the binding of nanorings with four or eight binding units to MCF-7 cells expressing a known abundance of receptor partners (Fig. {@fig:Csizmar}a).

Selectivity derived by changing valency is dependent on affinity. As many previous studies have suggested, lower affinity, multi-valent interactions have been shown to exhibit selectivity based on receptor abundance [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. Comparing binding between cell populations exposed to ligands of variable affinities over a range of ligand valency demonstrates this interplay (Fig. {@fig:valency}b-d). Here, the ligand binding ratios for $R_1$ between cell populations are shown for ligands of high, medium, and low affinities ($K_d$ of $1000$, $100$, and $10$ $\mathrm{nM}$). The ligand binding ratio between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ is maximized by low affinity ligands, but requires greater valency to achieve peak binding selectivity when compared to ligands of greater affinity (Fig. {@fig:valency}b). A similar valency optimum for a given affinity is seen for binding selectivity between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ (Fig. {@fig:valency}c-d). Ligands with lower affinities achieve optimal binding with higher valencies and exhibit higher selectivity for cells expressing greater amounts of receptor.

Our model allowed us to identify the mechanism of valency-mediated receptor abundance selectivity by looking at the number of complex bound in each degree. A cell expressing $10^4$ receptors displays similar amounts of binding at each valency for ligands with dissociation constants of $1000$, $100$, and $10 \mathrm{nM}$ (Fig. {@fig:valency}e). However, a cell expressing 10% as many receptors exhibits extremely low amounts of multivalent binding for ligand complexes of low binding affinity (Fig. {@fig:valency}f). This effect arises due to a higher dissociation rate than multi-valent binding association rate at low receptor abundances (Fig. {@fig:valency}g). Multivalent ligands will undergo initial binding events at rates unaffected by receptor abundance, but low affinity and receptor density severely limit the possibility of secondary binding events. In contrast, cells with higher receptor abundance accumulate ligand binding by binding ligand at high valency, as the rate of multi-valent binding is greater than that of disassociation (Fig. {@fig:valency}f). This effect allows for valency to provide selectivity between cells having differences in receptor expression density, where affinity alone fails.

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives a Limited Selectivity Enhancement of Mixtures

While most therapies rely on the action of a single molecular species, mixtures may enhance selectivity through combinations of actions [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1549]. Furthermore, some biologics inevitably act as mixtures of species through heterogeneity in glycosylation and the presence of endogenous ligands [@DOI:10.1002/rcm.3330]. Therefore, it is important to understand how mixtures of complexes influence the overall response.

To evaluate the contribution of mixtures, we evaluated model-predicted binding while varying the composition between ligands with either $R_1$ or $R_2$-preferred binding, respectively (Fig. {@fig:mixture}a). The trend that arises is very similar to an additive combination of the single ligand cases. This pattern highlights a key limitation of using mixtures for selectivity: selectivity between two populations varies monotonic with the composition, so any mixture combination is no better than using the more specific ligand entirely(Fig. {@fig:mixture}b).

While mixture engineering fails to enhance binding selectivity between two cell populations, it is potentially beneficial when considering two or more off-target cell populations. More specifically, when a target population expresses two target receptors, but off-target populations express each receptor individually in high amounts, drug mixtures can offer enhanced selectivity. For example, when maximizing targeting to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ over $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, which individually express high levels of the receptors found on the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, we show that a uniform mixture of ligands with high affinity for receptor 1 and 2 provides a modest improvement in targeting selectivity (Fig. {@fig:mixture}c). We also demonstrate the utility of mixture engineering in cell population combinations where many off-target populations are considered (Fig. {@fig:mixture}d). However, even in these cases, the magnitude of selectivity enhancement is modest. Finally, although we only consider the amount of binding, ligands can have non-overlapping signaling effects even with identical amounts of binding. In these cases, the effect of combinations can be distinct from either individual ligand [@pmid:28886385; @pmid:29960887].

### Heterovalent Bispecific Ligands Exhibit Unique Charateristics When Activated Fully Bound

Constructing multispecific drugs has become a promising new strategy for finer target cell specificity with the advancement of engineering techniques [@doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2168-1]. However, the number of possible configurations of multispecific drugs is combinatorially large and impossible to enumerate. Here, we use the heterovalent bispecific ligand as an example to explore the unique benefit of multispecificity distinct from any strategy analyzed before. We compared bispecificity with two aforementioned strategies: a 50%-50% mixture of two monovalent ligands, and a 50%-50% mixture of two different homogeneous bivalent ligands. These two strategies both have some similarities to bispecific therapeutics. A bispecific ligand contains two different ligand monomers with equal proportion, similar to a 50%-50% monovalent mixture. By comparing bispecific with a 50%-50% monovalent mixture, we can elucidate the extra benefit of tethering these two monomers into one complex. A bispecific ligand is also by nature bivalent, and by comparing it with homogeneous bivalent drugs, we can understand how having two different subunits in the same complex modify the behavior of a drug. Together, we sought to identify the unique advantage of heterovalency.

We first applied the binding model to predict the amount of ligand bound in bispecific drugs (Fig @fig:bispecific a), a 50%-50% mixture of two monomers (Fig @fig:bispecific b), and a 50%-50% mixture of two different homogeneous bivalents (Fig @fig:bispecific c), with the same set of parameters in ligand concentration and affinities. It turned out that the patterns of ligand bounds of these three cases are almost exactly the same, and bispecific doesn’t exhibit any merit. We then investigated if bispecific ligands that have to be activated with both of their subunits binding to a target display any special cell population selectivity characteristics. Bispecific ligands that require both subunits bound to be effective are common in the design of bispecific antibodies. To be specific, when the first antigen-binding region of a bispecific antibody docks at an antigen, it will only make a loose connection between the target and the antibody, unable to induce a strong immune response, and only when both antigen-binding regions bind to their target will this bispecific antibody be fully effective [@doi:10.1080/19420862.2015.1062192; @pmid:30145356].

To scrutinize the case where the target binding of both subunits is required, we extended our model to calculate the amount of ligand fully bound. For the heterovalent bispecific case, ligand fully bound will only account the amount of ligand with both of their ligand monomers bind to a target. With the same set of parameters, the predictions made for bispecific fully bound show a very distinct pattern from general ligand bound (Fig @fig:bispecific e). Besides that ligand fully bound has lower amounts, the contour plot of fully bound bispecific ligands has more concaved contour lines. For example, $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ has about the same level of general ligand bound as $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ (Fig @fig:bispecific a), but it has significantly more ligand fully bound than $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ (Fig @fig:bispecific e). This concavity of contour lines indicates that for bispecific complexes, ligand fully bound prefers double-positively expressed cells than singly-positively expressed cells. This should be obvious since these two subunits of the bispecific complex prefer different receptors. The results indicate that bispecific ligands will only exhibit special characteristics when it can only be activated fully bound. This characteristic opens up brand new engineering opportunities for targeting specific cell populations.

The specific amount of fully bound ligands depends on the propensity of crosslinking, captured by $K_x^*$. We plotted the pattern of bispecific fully bound with $K_x^* = 10^{-10}$, $10^{-12}$, and $10^{-14}$ (Fig. @fig:bispecific d-f). In general, when $K_x^*$ is larger, the ligands are more capable of multimerization, and there will be more fully bound units. To demonstrate how this characteristic of fully bound bispecific ligand imparts cell population specificity, we plotted the ratios of selectivities between some cell population pairs under bispecific versus another drugs given a range of $K_x^*$ (Figure @fig:bispecific g,h). These plotted numbers are ratios of ligand (fully) bound ratios between two cell populations, so when they are larger, it implies that fully bound bispecific ligand has more advantages than its counterpart to impart selective binding between these two cell populations. Figure @fig:bispecific g compares the selectivities under bispecific ligands versus a 50%-50% mixture of monovalent ligands. The results show that fully bound bispecific can grant better selective binding when $K_x^*$ is small enough. This logical, since when $K_x^*$ is small and crosslinking is rarer, most ligands will bind monovalently, and fully bound bispecific will especially favor the cell populations with higher receptor expression. However, when we compare fully bound bispecific to fully bound homogeneous bivalent mixtures (Fig. @fig:bispecific h), the advantage of bispecific drugs is not obvious except for $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ selectivity. Given that both therapeutics in comparison only account for fully bound ligands, the effect demonstrated in Figure @fig:bispecific g no longer holds. Together, we showed that bispecific ligands only exhibit unique advantages in inducing selective binding when they can only be effective when both of their subunits bind and crosslinking is more difficult.

### Combining Strategies For Superior Selectivity

Each strategy above provided selectivity benefits in distinct situations, suggesting that they might synergistically improve selectivity when combined. We explored this potential synergy using mathematical optimization to determine the optimally cell type selective ligand for our theoretical cell populations. Here, we sought to determine the optimal ligand for particular cell populations while considering all other theoretical populations as off-target cells. We set our initial binding selectivity performance metric and optimize it within set bounds (Fig. @fig:combination). To simulate the effects that affinity engineering, we allowed ligand-receptor affinities to vary. To understand the effects of valency and mixture engineering on selectivity, we allowed ligand valency and mixtures to vary, while also allowing affinity to vary due to the previously noted reliance that these strategies have on receptor-ligand kinetics. Finally, all ligand parameters were allowed to vary to simulate the effects of combining therapeutic engineering approaches.

Optimizing a ligand for selectivity to $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ highlights a situation in which combined affinity and valency individually impart greater specificity, and optimal selectivity is achieved by combining these two strategies (Fig. {@fig:combination}a-f). Here selectivity is optimized by ligands with selective binding to receptor 2, and those with valencies allowing for selective binding to cells with higher abundances of receptor expression. One case contradictory to this trend is shown during the optimization for selectivity towards the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ . While affinity, valency, and mixture engineering are able to impart some small contributions to enhanced selectivity, significant improvement is only achieved when combining them all (Fig. {@fig:combination}g-l). Here, synergistic combination of strategies can be employed to great effect, granting far superior ligand selectivity. A more difficult design problem is featured in the optimization of $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$. Since it lies in the midst of the other populations in receptor expression space (Fig. {@fig:mixture}m-r), any modulation of affinity, valency or combining it with mixture-based strategies seems ineffective.

Our results highlight that both in singular and combined strategies for therapeutic manipulation, the target and off-target populations dictate the optimal approach. It is also clear that combined approaches do offer synergies which can be harnessed, but that those are only emergent in particular therapeutic situations [@pmid:30145356].

### Using Binding Competition to Invert Receptor Targeting

While the strategies above provided selectivity in many cases, we recognized that they are all limited to a positive relationship between receptor abundance and binding. Therefore, we wondered if binding competition with a receptor antagonist, or "dead ligand", could invert this relationship.

To investigate the effect of ligand competition with an antagonist, we modeled mixtures of ligands, but only quantified the amount of binding for the active ligand. As binding is dependent upon the properties of both ligands, we chose to only consider a monovalent agonist and tetravalent antagonist (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}). We found that combinations of monovalent agonistic ligands and multivalent antagonistic ligands were able to uniquely target populations expressing small or intermediate amounts of receptors, which is demonstrated when comparing ligand binding ratios between $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}a). Here, a nearly tenfold increase in selectivity can be granted to monovalent agonists when combined with a tetravalent antagonist. In this case, there are greater quantities of agonist bound to $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ than $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}b). This is striking, as $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ expresses either as many or fewer abundances of receptors one and two when compared to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$. This phenomenon, which could not be achieved without multivalent antagonists, occurs due to the preferential binding of multivalent antagonists to populations expressing higher abundances of receptors (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}c). Thus, in cases where previously discussed ligand engineering strategies and approaches fail to achieve selective binding to cells expressing smaller or similar amounts of receptors to off-target populations, combinations of agonistic and antagonistic ligands may provide unique benefits.
