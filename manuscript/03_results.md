Here we investigate cell-specific targeting in a biophysical and quantitative manner. Drugs, including monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, and cytokines, can be categorized as ligands which bind to their respective receptors expressed on some cells, such as Fc receptors, antigen motifs, and cytokine receptors. When these ligands bind to the target cells, the drug enacts its intended action; when they bind to off-target cells, unintended effects or toxicity can arise. Some cell populations can be distinguished by the distinct receptor it expresses, such as T cells selective expression of CD3, or a specific motif of an antigen. But more commonly, target and off-target cells express the same collection of receptors, differing only in their intensity of expression. In such situations, engineering drugs optimized to achieve more ligand bound to the target cells while minimizing the binding to off-target cells is an area of ongoing research, and has inspired myriad drug design strategies [@doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6604700, @doi.org/10.1021/cb6003788, @doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7]. To answer this question, we must rely on quantitative binding estimation on these two cell populations.

While ligand to receptor binding events in biology are as universal as they are diverse, they can be generalized into simple protein-protein binding, which is governed by the thermodynamics properties and the law of mass action. When a reaction reaches its equilibrium state, the ratio of the concentration of ligand-receptor complex, $[LR]$, to the product of the concentrations of them each, $[L][R]$, shall be a constant number given the temperature known as the association constant, $K_a$. In a mechanistic model, it is usually assumed that the number of ligands in the solution is much higher than there are receptor-ligand binding events, and thus binding-dependent depletion doesn’t lead to a decrease in environmental concentration. In our case, we also assume the concentration of receptors is proportional to the number of receptors expressed by the cell population of interest by a constant, $K_x^*$. 

The binding behavior can be complicated when the ligands are multivalent complexes consists of multiple units each of which can bind to a receptor. While in the primary binding phase, the first subunit on a ligand complex binds according to the same dynamics that govern monovalent binding. Subsequent bindings however, exhibit different behavior due to steric effects. Here, we assume that the effective association constant for the subsequent bindings is proportional to that of the free binding. Another consideration that must be made when modeling multivalent binding processes iw whether a ligand complex is formed by a random assortment of monomer units, where the amounts of each monomer follow a multinomial distribution, or through specific engineering resulting in complexes of defined monomer composition. After taking all these components into account, we developed a multivalent binding model that calculates the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium. See the methods section for the details of this model.

In order to simplify the various strategies that can be employed during the design of cell-type selective drugs, we consider theoretical cell populations which express only two types of receptors that can bind to our ligands. The expression level of each receptor ranges from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>. Figure {@fig:model} shows the estimated log amount of binding of a monovalent ligand given the abundances of two receptors by color and contour map. The figure was plotted on logscale for x, y, and z axes, so the number of contour lines between two points on this contour map indicates the order of magnitude of the ligand bound ratio. For instance, in figure {@fig:model}a, cell populations at point 1 and point 2 are on the same contour line and their ligand bound are about the same level, but cell populations point 1 and point 3 have multiple contour lines between them and the ligand bound at point 3 is much higher than at point 1. (In fact, the ligand bound ratio can be read as the natural exponent of the difference between the contour line. In the case about point 3 to point 1, the ratio is about $e ^{4.6-2.3} \approx 7.4$.)

We chose the concentration of ligand, $L_0$, to be 10<sup>-9</sup> M, and the association constants to the two receptors to be 10<sup>5</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>, respectively, as an example. Figure 1a shows that when the amount of R<sub>1</sub> increases on a cell (a point moves rightward on the landscape of the contour map, e.g. from 1 to 2), the amount of binding doesn’t increase significantly. On the contrary, adding more R<sub>2</sub> (moving upward, e.g. from 1 to 3) will lead to a great boost on ligand bound. The high affinity of R<sub>2</sub> enables the cells to capture more ligands when expressing extra R<sub>2</sub> versus R<sub>1</sub>. This type of theoretical analysis is useful since adjusting the receptor expression profiles is a common strategy used by many cells. For example, human solid tumor cells upregulate their expression of CD47 to evade phagocytosis [@doi:10.1080/19420862.2015.1062192]. Understanding how the ligand bound changes associating to receptor expression modification can guide us to decide which drug achieves the best cell specificity.

To analyze more general cases, we conceptualize eight theoretical cell populations defined by the differential expression of two receptor types (R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> plotted on x and y axes). As shown in Fig {@fig:model}b, they either have high (10<sup>4</sup>), medium (10<sup>3</sup>), or low (10<sup>2</sup>) expression of R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>. These theoretical cell populations also show intrapopulation variability. For instance, the expression profile of R<sub>1</sub><sup>med</sup>R<sub>2</sub><sup>med</sup> has a wide range. We will use this binding model to examine how engineering on affinity, valency, and hetero-valent complexes improve cell-specific targeting. Although in our discussion, only two receptor types and two ligand subunit types were presented, the principles we generalize can be applied to more complex cases.

### Affinity Provides Selectivity Toward Cell Populations With Divergent Receptor Expression

B-F) Heatmap of binding ratio of cell populations exposed to a monovalent ligand with association constants to receptor 1 and 2 ranging from 10^4^ to 10^9^, at a concentration of 10 nM. B-E) Heatmaps show that engineering affinity is effective when target population has a greater relative abundance of one receptor to the off-target population, and that binding ratio ratio is largest when ligand is engineered to selectively bind that receptor. The maximum binding ratio achieved using this strategy is the ratio of the receptor on the target and off-target population. E) Heatmap shows that when relative abundance of both receptors is uniform between target and off-target population is uniform, engineering affinity is ineffective.](./output/figure2.svg){#fig:affinity}

When a target cell population expresses more of a certain receptor than other cells, enhancing the affinity of this receptor or reducing the affinity of competing receptors are obvious strategies to increase selective binding. As an example, cell type 3 expresses a high amount of receptor 1, while type 4 receptor 2 (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). Enhancing ligand affinity for receptor 1 and weakening its interaction with receptor 2 results in improved binding selectivity for the r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$" population over the r"$R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$" population (Fig. {@fig:affinity}e). Unsurprisingly, all cell populations expressing high abundances of receptor 1 bind greater amounts of ligand in this case. The contour plot on the background shows this trend more intuitively: when the affinity of receptor 1 increases (from the subplots on the left to those on the right), the contour lines shift inward and cluster more densely, indicating an enhanced sensitivity of binding to expression of receptor 1.

However, just as often, both on- and off-target cell populations express the same set of receptors and only differ in their level of expression. An example of this pattern are the r"$R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$" and r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$" populations (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). In this case, the benefit of affinity changes is weakened. Selectively enhancing affinity for the receptor most abundantly expressed on a target population and weakening its interaction with other shared receptors is efficacious in increasing binding selectivity; however, the magnitude of selectivity is limited (Fig. {@fig:affinity}c). Thus, identifying which receptors a cell population of interest expresses most uniquely is critical.

Cell populations are made up of individual cells with heterogeneous amounts of receptor. For example, in (Fig. @fig:affinity), receptor abundances of type 8 have high variance. The eclipse representing its range of receptor abundances rides through multiple contour lines, indicating how wide the bound ligand values span. If we choose to maneuver the affinity of receptor 1 to attain more selective binding to the r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$" population over the r"$R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$" population, it can be expected that the binding ratio will exhibit higher fluctuation (Fig. @fig:affinity).

### Valency Enables Selectivity To Cell Populations Based On Receptor Expression Levels

While affinity modulation techniques are effective for the selective targeting of cell populations expressing unique or mutated receptors, they remain largely inadequate for the targeting of cell populations expressing receptor profiles similar to those of off-target populations. In such cases, therapeutic ligands solely engineered with altered receptor binding activity are known to suffer from significant off-target toxicities, as monovalent ligands fail to distinguish between populations with varying receptor abundances, binding each with equal avidity [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. Valency engineering offers a promising avenue for distinguishing between such divergent populations, as multivalent ligand binding avidity is known to vary as a function of cellular receptor abundance, as well as ligand concentration and binding affinity [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. These characteristics governing multivalent binding has been leveraged for effective targeting of cancer cells known to overexpress receptors shared with native tissue, but holistic understanding of the binding mechanisms at play has remained elusive [@doi:10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.07.040]. We utilized our binding model to explore the interplay between these factors, and to define engineering specifications for cell-type selective multivalent ligands.

B) Fraction of receptors bound by a high and low affinity ligand (($K_a$) = 10^8^, 10^7^ respectively) in four valencies over a range of receptors/cell. Fraction bound is constant for monovalent ligand, and increases at higher receptor counts for ligands of higher valencies. C) Fraction of receptors bound by a tetravalent ligand with a association constant of 10^8^ at a variety of concentrations over a range of receptors/cell. Values coalesce at higher receptor counts.

D-F) Varying valency is an effective strategy for target and off-target population pairs with large receptor abundance discrepancies, especially using ligands with low affinities at low concentrations. G-I) Binding ratios between population pairs with similar receptor counts fails to vary with valency of ligand.](./output/figure3.svg){#fig:valency}

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives Enhanced Selectivity Of Mixtures

While the action of many therapeutics relies on cellular response to a single type of molecule, it has been shown in some cases that combinatorial, or mixed molecule therapeutics offer enhanced activation selectivity and therefore increased efficacy [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1549]. In cases where multiple ligands are known to bind to and activate available receptors of interest on both target and off-target cells, therapeutic cocktails containing two or more therapeutic ligands can offer unique targeting characteristics when compared to therapeutics of homogenous molecular make-up. Here, we explore the binding behavior exhibited by mixtures of monovalent ligands.

The binding trends that arise while adjusting the composition of a ligand mixture of constant concentration and containing 2 ligands, each exhibiting preferential binding to a particular receptor is summarized in (Fig. @fig:mixture). The trend that arises is followed intuitively; the magnitude of ligand binding for cell populations exhibiting higher abundances of a particular receptor is maximized when exposed to a drug mixture containing larger amounts of ligand which binds that receptor with high affinity. To highlight this effect, we can compare the binding of the r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$" population to the r"$R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$" population, which are rich in one receptor 1 or 2, and deficient in the other, and both of which feature maximum binding at one extrema of mixture composition (Fig. @fig:mixture). The consequences of this phenomena dictate the key limitation governing the utility of mixture engineering; when attempting the maximize binding selectivity of a drug for one population over another single population, the maximum binding ratio will always occur when using a mixture containing a single ligand species (figure S-lines). The exception to the rule occurs when the ratios of each receptor type on both target and off-target populations is uniform, in which case engineering mixture composition will have no effect on binding ratio (Fig. @fig:mixture).

While mixture engineering fails to enhance binding selectivity between two cell populations, it remains potentially effective when considering multiple off-target cell populations. In situations where target populations uniformly express high levels of target receptors, but selective targeting is complicated by cell populations which express each receptor individually in high abundances, drug mixtures can offer optimal activation selectivity. For example, when attempting to target a cell population which mirrors the expression levels of the r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$" population, and maximize the binding with respect to two off target populations such as r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$" and r"$R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$", which individually express high levels of the receptors found on the r"$R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$" popluation, we show that a uniform mixture of ligands with high affinity for receptor 1 and 2 provides optimal targeting selectivity (Fig line). We also demonstrate utility of mixture engineering in several potential target-off target cell population combinations, where multiple off target populations are considered in fig lines-. However, in many of these cases, the magnitude of selectivity is limited by the prevalence of available off-target receptors. To summarize, we show that drug cocktails composed of multiple active ligands are uniquely effective in enhancing targeting selectivity when multiple off-target populations share receptors of interest with the targeted population.

B) Binding ratio between population 3 and 2. Mixtures cannot enhance selectivity between a target population and a single off-target population. C-F) Binding ratios between a target and multiple off-target populations. The minimum binding ratio between these pairs is reported. With multiple off-target populations, mixtures can achieve superior cell-type selectivity to singular ligand compositions.](./output/figure4.svg){#fig:mixture}
