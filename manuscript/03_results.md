### Affinity Provides Selectivity Toward Cell Populations With Divergent Receptor Expression

B-F) Heatmap of binding ratio of cell populations exposed to a monovalent ligand with association constants to receptor 1 and 2 ranging from 10^4^ to 10^9^, at a concentration of 10 nM. B-E) Heatmaps show that engineering affinity is effective when target population has a greater relative abundance of one receptor to the off-target population, and that binding ratio ratio is largest when ligand is engineered to selectively bind that receptor. The maximum binding ratio achieved using this strategy is the ratio of the receptor on the target and off-target population. E) Heatmap shows that when relative abundance of both receptors is uniform between target and off-target population is uniform, engineering affinity is ineffective.](./output/figure2.svg){#fig:affinity}

When a target cell population expresses more of a certain receptor than other cells, enhancing the affinity of this receptor or reducing the affinity of competing receptors are obvious strategies to increase selective binding. As an example, cell type 3 expresses a high amount of receptor 1, while type 4 receptor 2 (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). Enhancing ligand affinity for receptor 1 and weakening its interaction with receptor 2 results in improved binding selectivity for population 3 over 4 (Fig. {@fig:affinity}b). Unsurprisingly, all cell populations expressing high abundances of receptor 1 bind greater amounts of ligand in this case. The contour plot on the background shows this trend more intuitively: when the affinity of receptor 1 increases (from the subplots on the left to those on the right), the contour lines shift inward and cluster more densely, indicating an enhanced sensitivity of binding to expression of receptor 1.

However, just as often, both on- and off-target cell populations express the same set of receptors and only differ in their level of expression. An example of this pattern is cell types 5 and 6 (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). In this case, the benefit of affinity changes is weakened. Selectively enhancing affinity for the receptor most abundantly expressed on a target population and weakening its interaction with other shared receptors is efficacious in increasing binding selectivity; however, the magnitude of selectivity is limited (Fig. {@fig:affinity}c). Thus, identifying which receptors a cell population of interest expresses most uniquely is critical.

Cell populations are made up of individual cells with heterogeneous amounts of receptor. For example, in (Fig. @fig:affinity), receptor abundances of type 8 have high variance. The eclipse representing its range of receptor abundances rides through multiple contour lines, indicating how wide the bound ligand values span. If we choose to maneuver the affinity of receptor 1 to attain more selective binding to type 3 over type 8, it can be expected that the binding ratio will exhibit higher fluctuation (Fig. @fig:affinity).

### Valency Enables Selectivity To Cell Populations Based On Receptor Expression Levels

While affinity modulation techniques are effective for the selective targeting of cell populations expressing unique or mutated receptors, they remain largely inadequate for the targeting of cell populations expressing receptor profiles similar to those of off-target populations. In such cases, therapeutic ligands solely engineered with altered receptor binding activity are known to suffer from significant off-target toxicities, as monovalent ligands fail to distinguish between populations with varying receptor abundances, binding each with equal avidity [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. Valency engineering offers a promising avenue for distinguishing between such divergent populations, as multivalent ligand binding avidity is known to vary as a function of cellular receptor abundance, as well as ligand concentration and binding affinity [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. These characteristics governing multivalent binding has been leveraged for effective targeting of cancer cells known to overexpress receptors shared with native tissue, but holistic understanding of the binding mechanisms at play has remained elusive [@doi:10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.07.040]. We utilized our binding model to explore the interplay between these factors, and to define engineering specifications for cell-type selective multivalent ligands.

B) Fraction of receptors bound by a high and low affinity ligand (($K_a$) = 10^8^, 10^7^ respectively) in four valencies over a range of receptors/cell. Fraction bound is constant for monovalent ligand, and increases at higher receptor counts for ligands of higher valencies. C) Fraction of receptors bound by a tetravalent ligand with a association constant of 10^8^ at a variety of concentrations over a range of receptors/cell. Values coalesce at higher receptor counts.

D-F) Varying valency is an effective strategy for target and off-target population pairs with large receptor abundance discrepancies, especially using ligands with low affinities at low concentrations. G-I) Binding ratios between population pairs with similar receptor counts fails to vary with valency of ligand.](./output/figure3.svg){#fig:valency}

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives Enhanced Selectivity Of Mixtures

While the action of many therapeutics relies on cellular response to a single type of molecule, it has been shown in some cases that combinatorial, or mixed molecule therapeutics offer enhanced activation selectivity and therefore increased efficacy [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1549]. In cases where multiple ligands are known to bind to and activate available receptors of interest on both target and off-target cells, therapeutic cocktails containing two or more therapeutic ligands can offer unique targeting characteristics when compared to therapeutics of homogenous molecular make-up. Here, we explore the binding behavior exhibited by mixtures of monovalent ligands.

The binding trends that arise while adjusting the composition of a ligand mixture of constant concentration and containing 2 ligands, each exhibiting preferential binding to a particular receptor is summarized in (Fig. @fig:mixture). The trend that arises is followed intuitively; the magnitude of ligand binding for cell populations exhibiting higher abundances of a particular receptor is maximized when exposed to a drug mixture containing larger amounts of ligand which binds that receptor with high affinity. To highlight this effect, we can compare the binding of population 3 and 4, which are rich in one receptor 1 or 2, and deficient in the other, and both of which feature maximum binding at one extrema of mixture composition (Fig. @fig:mixture). The consequences of this phenomena dictate the key limitation governing the utility of mixture engineering; when attempting the maximize binding selectivity of a drug for one population over another single population, the maximum binding ratio will always occur when using a mixture containing a single ligand species (figure S-lines). The exception to the rule occurs when the ratios of each receptor type on both target and off-target populations is uniform, in which case engineering mixture composition will have no effect on binding ratio (Fig. @fig:mixture).

While mixture engineering fails to enhance binding selectivity between two cell populations, it remains potentially effective when considering multiple off-target cell populations. In situations where target populations uniformly express high levels of target receptors, but selective targeting is complicated by cell populations which express each receptor individually in high abundances, drug mixtures can offer optimal activation selectivity. For example, when attempting to target a cell population which mirrors the expression levels of population 7, and maximize the binding with respect to two off target populations such as 3 and 4, which individually express high levels of the receptors found on population 7, we show that a uniform mixture of ligands with high affinity for receptor 1 and 2 provides optimal targeting selectivity (Fig line). We also demonstrate utility of mixture engineering in several potential target-off target cell population combinations, where multiple off target populations are considered in fig lines-. However, in many of these cases, the magnitude of selectivity is limited by the prevalence of available off-target receptors. To summarize, we show that drug cocktails composed of multiple active ligands are uniquely effective in enhancing targeting selectivity when multiple off-target populations share receptors of interest with the targeted population.

B-F) Binding ratio between target and off-target populations exposed to a mixture of two monovalent ligands at a concentration of 10 nM. Ligand 1 binds with high affinity (($K_a$) = 10^9^) for receptor 1 and low affinity to receptor 2 (($K_a$) = 10^2^), while ligand 2 binds with high affinity to receptor two, and low affinity to receptor 1. B) Binding ratio between population 3 and 2. Mixtures cannot enhance selectivity between a target population and a single off-target population. C-F) Binding ratios between a target and multiple off-target populations. The minimum binding ratio between these pairs is reported. With multiple off-target populations, mixtures can achieve superior cell-type selectivity to singular ligand compositions.](./output/figure4.svg){#fig:mixture}
