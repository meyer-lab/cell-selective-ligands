### Model System For Exploring The Contributing Factors To Cell Selectivity

![**A model system for exploring the contributing factors to cell selectivity.** A) Experimentally measured IL-2Rα and IL2Rβ abundances of a panel of PBMC-derived subpopulations. Relative receptor abundances are a key factor in cell-selective ligand engineering. B) Receptor abundances of a panel of theoretical cell populations. Strategies for selectively binding each example population relative to another are explored. D) Association constants ($K_a$) of several γ~c~ cytokine and FcG receptor-ligand complexes. Both γ~c~ cytokines and FcG ligands are often engineered for enhanced cell-type selectivity.](./output/figure1.svg){#fig:model}

### Affinity Provides Selectivity To Cell Populations With Unique Receptor Expression

Text.

![**Affinity provides selectivity to cell populations with unique receptor expression.** A) Receptor abundances of a panel of theoretical cell populations. B-F) Heatmap of binding ratio of cell populations exposed to a monovalent ligand with association constants to receptor 1 and 2 ranging from 10^4^ to 10^9^, at a concentration of 10 nM. B-E) Heatmaps show that engineering affinity is effective when target population has a greater relative abundance of one receptor to the off-target population, and that binding ratio ratio is largest when ligand is engineered to selectively bind that receptor. The maximum binding ratio achieved using this strategy is the ratio of the receptor on the target and off-target population. E) Heatmap shows that when relative abundance of both receptors is uniform between target and off-target population is uniform, engineering affinity is ineffective.](./output/figure2.svg){#fig:affinity}

### Valency Enables Selectivity To Cell Populations Based On Receptor Expression Levels

Text.

![**Valency provides selectivity based on receptor expression levels.** A) Receptor abundances of a panel of theoretical cell populations. B) Fraction of receptors bound by a high and low affinity ligand (($K_a$) = 10^8^, 10^7^ respectively) in four valencies over a range of receptors/cell. Fraction bound is constant for monovalent ligand, and increases at higher receptor counts for ligands of higher valencies. C) Fraction of receptors bound by a tetravalent ligand with a association constant of 10^8^ at a variety of concentrations over a range of receptors/cell. Values coalesce at higher receptor counts. D-I) Binding ratio between target and off-target populations at a range of valencies for ligands at pairs of high, medium, and low concentrations and affinities to receptor 1 and 2 (10 nM, 1 nM, and 0.1 nM, and 10^6^, 10^7^, and 10^8^ respectively). D-F) Varying valency is an effective strategy for target and off-target population pairs with large receptor abundance discrepancies, especially using ligands with low affinities at low concentrations. G-I) Binding ratios between population pairs with similar receptor counts fails to vary with valency of ligand.](./output/figure3.svg){#fig:valency}

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives Enhanced Selectivity Of Mixtures

Text.

![**Ligand mixtures with non-overlapping responses can enhance selectivity.** A) Receptor abundances of a panel of theoretical cell populations. B-F) Binding ratio between target and off-target populations exposed to a mixture of two monovalent ligands at a concentration of 10 nM. Ligand 1 binds with high affinity (($K_a$) = 10^9^) for receptor 1 and low affinity to receptor 2 (($K_a$) = 10^2^), while ligand 2 binds with high affinity to receptor two, and low affinity to receptor 1. B) Binding ratio between population 3 and 2. Mixtures cannot enhance selectivity between a target population and a single off-target population. C-F) Binding ratios between a target and multiple off-target populations. The minimum binding ratio between these pairs is reported. With multiple off-target populations, mixtures can achieve superior cell-type selectivity to singular ligand compositions.](./output/figure4.svg){#fig:mixture}
