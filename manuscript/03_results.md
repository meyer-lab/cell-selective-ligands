Here we investigate cell-specific targeting quantitatively by extending an equilibrium, multi-valent, multi-ligand binding model. Virtually any therapy, including monoclonal antibodies, small-molecule inhibitors, and cytokines, can be thought of as ligands for respective receptors expressed on target cells. Ligand binding to target cells is the first step and essential for a drug's intended action; in contrast, binding to off-target cells can result in unintended effects or toxicity. Some cell populations can be distinguished by unique receptor expression, but more commonly target and off-target cells express the same collection of receptors and differ only in their amounts. In such situations, engineering drugs optimized to achieve more ligand bound to the target cells, while minimizing the binding to off-target cells, is an area of ongoing research and has inspired myriad drug design strategies [@doi:10.1038/sj.bjc.6604700; @doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0830-7]. We will use a quantitative binding estimation for these two cell populations to examine these strategies.

While ligand-receptor binding events in biology are diverse, they are governed by their thermodynamic properties and the law of mass action. When a reaction reaches its equilibrium state, the ratio of the concentration of monomeric ligand-receptor complex, $[LR]$, to the product of the concentrations of each, $[L][R]$, can be defined as an association constant $K_a$. The number of ligands in the solution is usually much greater than that of the receptors so that binding does not deplete the ligand concentration.

Binding behavior is more complex when the ligands are multivalent complexes consisting of multiple units, each of which can bind to a receptor (Fig. {@fig:model}a). During an initial association, the first subunit on a ligand complex binds according to the same dynamics that govern monovalent binding. Subsequent bindings events exhibit different behavior, however. Here, we assume that the effective association constant for the subsequent bindings is proportional to that of the free binding, but scaled by a constant, $K_x^*$, due to its different local concentration and steric effects. Another consideration that must be made when modeling multivalent binding processes is whether a ligand complex is formed by a random assortment of monomer units or by specific engineering resulting in complexes of a defined monomer composition. We developed a multivalent binding model that calculates the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium taking each of these factors into account (see methods).

As a simplification, we will consider theoretical cell populations that express only two types of receptors that bind to our ligands (Fig. {@fig:model}b), ranging in abundance from 100 to 10,000 per cell. Figure {@fig:model}c shows the log-scaled predicted amount of binding of a monovalent ligand given the abundance of two receptors. Because all axes are log-scaled the number of contour lines between two points indicates the ratio of ligand binding between populations. For instance, in figure {@fig:model}c, cell populations at points 1 and 2 are on the same contour line and thus have the same amount of ligand bound; the cell populations at points 1 and 3 have multiple contour lines between and so point 3 has more ligand binding. (In fact, the ratio can be read as the exponent of the contour line difference. For point 3 to point 1, the ratio is $e ^{4.6-2.3} \approx 7.4$.)

As an example, we chose the concentration of ligand, $L_0$, to be 1 nM, and the association constants to the two receptors to be $10^5 M^{-1}$ and $10^7 M^{-1}$, respectively. Figure {@fig:model}c shows that when the amount of $R_1$ increases on a cell (a point moves rightward, e.g. from 1 to 2), the amount of binding doesn’t increase significantly. On the contrary, adding more $R_2$ (moving upward, e.g. from 1 to 3) will lead to a great boost on ligand bound. The high affinity of $R_2$ enables the cells to capture more ligands if they were to express more $R_2$ as compared to more $R_1$. This situation would correspond to some cue inducing expression of a receptor (e.g. interferon-induced upregulation of MHC [CITE], or regulatory T cell upregulation of IL-2R⍺ [CITE]).

To analyze more general cases, we defined eight theoretical cell populations according to their differential expression of two receptor types ($R_1$ and $R_2$ plotted on x and y axes). As shown in Fig {@fig:model}d, they either have high ($10^4$), medium ($10^3$), or low ($10^2$) expression of $R_1$ and $R_2$. To account for cell-to-cell heterogeneity, we also defined intrapopulation variability. For instance, the expression profile of $R_1^{med} R_2^{med}$ has a wider range. We will use this binding model to examine how engineering on affinity, valency, and hetero-valent complexes improve cell-specific targeting. Although we will only consider two receptor and ligand subunit types, respectively, the principles we present generalize to more complex cases.

### Affinity Provides Selectivity Toward Cell Populations With Divergent Receptor Expression

![**Affinity provides selectivity to cell populations with unique receptor expression.** a) Heat/contour maps of monovalent ligand bound to cell populations given their expression profiles of two receptors. Ligand association constants to these receptors range from 10^5^, to 10^7^ $M^{-1}$. b-e) Heatmap of binding ratio of cell populations exposed to a monovalent ligand with association constants to receptor 1 and 2 ranging from 10^5^ to 10^7^ $M^{-1}$, at a concentration of 10 nM. b) Ligand bound ratio of $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$, c) $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$, d) $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ to $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}, and e) $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ to $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}](./output/figure2.svg){#fig:affinity}

When a target cell population expresses more of a certain receptor than other cells, enhancing the affinity of this receptor or reducing the affinity of competing receptors are obvious strategies to increase selective binding (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). As an example, cell type $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ expresses a high amount of receptor 1, while type $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ expresses receptor 2 at a higher abundance (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). Enhancing ligand affinity for receptor 1 and weakening its interaction with receptor 2 results in improved binding selectivity toward $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ over the $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ population (Fig. {@fig:affinity}e). Unsurprisingly, all cell populations with abundant receptor 1 bind greater amounts of ligand in this case. The contour plot on the background shows this trend more intuitively: when the affinity of receptor 1 increases (from the subplots on the left to those on the right), the contour lines shift inward and cluster more densely, indicating an enhanced sensitivity of binding to expression of receptor 1.

However, just as often, both on- and off-target cell populations express the same set of receptors and only differ in their level of expression. An example of this pattern are the $R_1^{med}R_2^{hi}$ and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ populations (Fig. {@fig:affinity}a). In this case, the benefit of affinity changes is weakened. Selectively enhancing affinity for the receptor most abundantly expressed on a target population and weakening its interaction with other shared receptors is efficacious in increasing binding selectivity; however, the magnitude of this effect is limited to the fold-difference in receptor amounts (Fig. {@fig:affinity}c). Thus, identifying which receptors a cell population of interest expresses most uniquely is critical.

Cell populations are made up of individual cells with heterogeneous amounts of receptor. For example, in (Fig. @fig:affinity), receptor abundances of type 8 have high variance. The eclipse representing its range of receptor abundances rides through multiple contour lines, indicating how wide the bound ligand values span. If we choose to maneuver the affinity of receptor 1 to attain more selective binding to the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ population over the $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ population, it can be expected that the binding ratio will exhibit higher fluctuation (Fig. @fig:affinity).

### Valency Enables Selectivity To Cell Populations Based On Receptor Expression Levels

Given the limitations of deriving selectivity from changes in affinity, we explored the contribution of valency changes. Multivalent ligand binding uniquely differs from monovalent binding due to it's non-linear relationship with cellular receptor density. Valency engineering thus allows ligands to selectively target cells with greater receptor expression densities. The effects of varying ligand valency are visualized in Figure 3a. Here, the amount of ligand bound, whose monovalent forms has equal affinity for receptors one and two, is plotted by receptor 1 and 2 expression amount, and the valency of the ligand is varied across subplots. The most notable effect of varying valency is shown to be the variable density of binding amount isoclines in the contour plot. For example, in the monovalent case, the relative levels of binding of $R_1^{lo}R_2^{lo}$, $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$,  and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$, all of which have proportionally identical expression of receptors 1 and 2, can be exactly described by relative receptor abundance levels. However, in the multivalent case, the density of contour isoclines varies as a function of receptor expression, causing the ligand binding discrepancy between these populations to vary widely. The location of the densest changes in ligand binding also varies between ligands of valency 4 and 16, demonstrating the tunability of valency engineering.

Selectivity derived from valency engineering also shares a strong reliance on monomer binding affinity. Lower affinity interactions have been shown to exhibit higher levels of selectivity for target cells, in agreeance with our model [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788; @doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. A comparison of binding levels between cell populations exposed to ligands of variable affinities over a range of ligand valency formats demonstrates the magnitude of this interplay (Fig. {@fig:valency}b-d). Here, ligand binding ratios of cell populations with variable absolute receptor expression levels are shown for ligands of high, medium, and low affinities (association constants of 10e^5^, 10e^6^, 10e^7^ M^{-1}). For example, the ligand binding ratios between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{lo}$ is maximized by low affinity ligands, but require greater valency to achieve peak binding selectivity when compared to ligands of greater affinity (Fig. {@fig:valency}b). A similar "sweet spot" of binding affinity and ligand valency is shown to maximize binding selectivity between $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$, and $R_1^{hi}R_2^{med}$ and $R_1^{med}R_2^{med}$ (Fig. {@fig:valency}c-d). It should also be noted that the magnitude and location of this selectivity peak fluctuates with ligand concentration, due to the similar mathematical effects on binding behavior concentration shares with binding affinity.

The selectivity for cells expressing higher abundances of receptors exhibited by multivalent ligands can be visualized by examining the degree of binding achieved by the ligands. A cell expressing 10^4^ receptors displays similar amounts of ligand binding at each degree for ligands with association constants of 10^6^, 10^7^, and 10^8^ (Fig. {@fig:valency}e). However, a cell expressing a degree of magnitude fewer receptors exhibits extremely low amounts of multivalent binding for ligands complexes of low binding affinity, an effect which illustrates the large binding ratios which can be achieved using low affinity multivalent ligands (Fig. {@fig:valency}f). The mechanism dictating this lack of high-degree binding in cells with low receptor expression densities arises due to a relatively large dissociation rate when compared to a subsequent binding association rate (Fig. {@fig:valency}g). Multivalent ligands will undergo uninhibited primary binding events regardless of cellular receptor expression density, but low affinity or density, combined with steric effects, severely limit the extent of secondary binding events and beyond. Thus, cells with higher receptor expression levels enjoy larger quantities of ligand binding due to a velcro like effect imparted by higher degree binding, while cells with lower receptor expression bind ligand only at lower degrees. This effect allows for valency engineering to impart powerful selectivity between cells with differences in receptor expression density, where affinity may fail.

### Non-Overlapping Ligand Targeting Drives Enhanced Selectivity Of Mixtures

While most therapies rely on the action of a single molecular species, in some cases combinatorial or mixed molecule therapeutics offer enhanced activation selectivity and therefore increased efficacy [@doi:10.1038/nbt.1549]. In cases where multiple ligands are known to bind to and activate available receptors of interest on both target and off-target cells, therapeutic cocktails containing two or more therapeutic ligands might offer unique targeting characteristics. Here, we explore the binding behavior exhibited by mixtures of monovalent ligands.

The binding trends that arise while adjusting the composition of a ligand mixture of constant concentration and containing 2 ligands, each exhibiting preferential binding to a particular receptor is summarized in (Fig. @fig:mixture). The trend that arises is followed intuitively; the magnitude of ligand binding for cell populations exhibiting higher abundances of a particular receptor is maximized when exposed to a drug mixture containing larger amounts of ligand which binds that receptor with high affinity. To highlight this effect, we can compare the predicted binding to the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$ populations (Fig. @fig:mixture). The consequences of this phenomena dictate the key limitation governing the utility of mixture engineering; when attempting the maximize binding selectivity of a drug for one population over another single population, the maximum binding ratio will always occur when using a mixture containing a single ligand species (figure S-lines). The exception to the rule occurs when the ratios of each receptor type on both target and off-target populations is uniform, in which case engineering mixture composition will have no effect on binding ratio (Fig. @fig:mixture).

While mixture engineering fails to enhance binding selectivity between two cell populations, it is potentially effective when considering three or more off-target cell populations. In situations where target populations express high levels of both target receptors, but selective targeting is complicated by cell populations which express each receptor individually in high amounts, drug mixtures can offer enhanced selectivity. For example, when attempting to target a cell population which mirrors the expression levels of the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ population, and maximize the binding with respect to two off target populations such as $R_1^{hi}R_2^{lo}$ and $R_1^{lo}R_2^{hi}$, which individually express high levels of the receptors found on the $R_1^{hi}R_2^{hi}$ popluation, we show that a uniform mixture of ligands with high affinity for receptor 1 and 2 provides optimal targeting selectivity (Fig line). We also demonstrate utility of mixture engineering in several potential target-off target cell population combinations, where multiple off target populations are considered in fig lines-. However, even in these cases, the magnitude of selectivity enhancement is limited.
