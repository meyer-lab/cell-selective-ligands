## Discussion

<!-- Summary. -->

Here, we employ a multivalent binding model, which has been shown to accurately recapitulate complex binding phenomena, to explore the situational efficacy of various ligand engineering strategies. Selective targeting of specific cell populations to reduce off-target effects has long been of interest in the design of potent and non-toxic therapies. We use our multivalent model to elucidate guidelines for the engineering of ligands which selectively bind targeting of cellular populations according to their unique receptor profiles. We considered distinct engineering strategies, including modulation of receptor-ligand kinetics, ligand valency manipulation, mixtures of therapeutics, and bispecificity, as well as the potential synergies offered by employing these strategies simultaneously. The computational was analyses were performed on a family of theoretical cell populations uniquely defined by their expression of two receptors. It should be noted that while only two receptors are considered to define unique populations in this study, the trends which we describe as a result of the various ligand engineering techniques considered can be extended to populations defined by larger numbers of receptor expressed.

We found that affinity engineering was most efficacious when target and off-target populations expressed different relative levels of the two receptor types, with greater discrepancies enhancing the benefits afforded by affinity engineering. When target and off-target populations express similar relative levels of receptors, and affinity engineering was rendered ineffective, we found that valency engineering offered a unique avenue for selective population targeting. The selectivity imparted through valency engineering was greatest when target and off target populations displayed receptors in great differences of magnitudes - the efficacy of valency engineering was also greatly interdependent on the kinetics of the receptor-ligand interactions, as the selectivity was imparted through a "velcro effect", where the rate of secondary binding interactions relative to the rate of unbinding is a key determinant of binding magnitude in multivalent binding. This rate is also highly dependent on receptor expression abundances on the populations of interest, creating an interplay between affinity, expression density, and ligand valency in the determination of optimal ligand characteristics. Mixtures of therapeutic ligands were found to be mostly innefective in imparting cell-type selectivity, and only demonstrated utility when binding to target populations was compared to binding events on multiple off-target populations. The selectivity imparted using mixtures of ligands was mostly limited even in such targeting situations however. We then considered whether synergies between these ligand engineering techniques could be exploited to achieve enhanced binding selectivity. Using mathematical optimization, we found that in most cases, while a single ligand engineering strategy dominated in it's contributions to cell-type selectivity, in some cases synergies between these strategies exist and can be exploited to grant even greater degrees of binding selectivity.

<!-- A number of strategies are already employed. -->

A number of strategies identified are already observed in existing engineered therapies. For example, affinity changes in the cytokine IL-2 have been used to bias its effects towards either effector or regulatory immune populations [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1495; @pmid:30446251]. Varying the valency of tumor-targeted antibodies leads to targeted cell clearance based upon the levels of expressed antigen [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. Manipulation of the affinities of fibronectin domains displayed by octovalent nanorings was shown to enhance the selectivity of binding to cancerous cells displaying relatively higher densities of fibronectin receptors compared to native tissue [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. The advantages offered by therapeutics reliant on low-affinity, multivalent interactions to selectively bind cells with high receptor expression densities was also described in a study considering a therapeutic reliant on multivalent complement binding to small-molecule therapeutics with αvβ3 binding domains, which is expressed at higher densities on tumor cells, and ⍺-Gal binding domains which are recognized by multivalent human anti-α-galactosyl antibodies [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. These examples lend support for the accuracy of our model. At the same time, recognizing the previously described ligand engineering approaches as separable strategies provides clearer guidance for future engineering.

<!-- Still need to implement others. -->

While many of the strategies described in this study have been examined in the academic setting, their advantages, and synergies have yet to be exploited in the clinical setting. Emerging therapeutic areas such as the burgeoning family of bispecific antibody therapeutics represent promising avenues for the application of concepts explored in this study. However, even these therapeutics have yet to benefit from the engineering guidelines offered by a computational binding model. We have shown that complex relationships between ligand-receptor kinetics, affinities, and therapeutic mixture compositions determine binding phenomena, and that the optimal manipulations of these ligand characteristics to enhance target selectivity are uniquely determined by not only the receptor expression unique to the population of interest, but also of off-target populations. The synergies offered by guided combinations of these strategies are promising for the development of therapeutics with reduced off-target activation and thus reduced toxicities, often allowing for significant improvements over traditional affinity based approaches (Fig. {@fig:combination}).

<!-- No strategies for NOT relationships. -->

While exploration of our multivalent binding model has elucidated strategies for selective targeting of many populations with respect to one or many off-target populations, several inter-population receptor expression relationships remain challenging to impart selectivity to. For example, target populations which unilaterally express fewer receptors of every type than off-target populations present a unique challenge for the design of a selective ligand. While we computationally show the potential for the simultaneous use of multi-valent "dead" ligands, which bind but do not induce a response, and monovalent "live" ligands to exploit reduced receptor expression levels, the translation of such a therapeutic to a clinical application remains questionable (Fig. {@fig:combination} s-v). In cases where a target population expresses fewer receptors of any kind than an off-target population, our analysis suggests that other target receptors or therapeutic strategies should be considered. However, in cases where target populations express more of any type of receptor than an off-target population, we show that one or more of our formulated ligand engineering strategies can be employed to improve binding selectivity.

<!-- Impressive range of logic can be built without cells involved. -->

In many therapeutic applications where selective engagement of target cell populations is an important performance metric, such as the treatment of cancer, cellular engineering is becoming increasingly popular [@doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-042718-041407]. Human engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are being introduced in the clinical setting at a rapid rate, and advances in genetic engineering technologies have enhanced the potential of engineered immune cells to recognize and attack malignant tissues [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.06.012]. These technologies bypass ligand-receptor binding considerations by manipulating the complexities of the immune system to attack cells expressing particular receptors - however manipulations of the immune system inevitably lead to myriad unintended effects due to the complex regulatory mechanisms which control immune activation and activity. We have shown here that complex and targeted changes to the binding activity of simple therapeutic ligands can be achieved via simple ligand characteristic manipulation. These manipulations can be generally applied to achieve greater selectivity, as well as more precisely guided using a computational binding model. The impressive array of logic described in this study can be applied to guide rational ligand engineering applications. It should be noted that application of this logic is reliant on knowledge of target and off-target cell population receptor expression levels. Future application of the ligand binding logic described in this study could be guided using high throughput single-cell profiling techniques, such as RNA-seq or high-parameter flow cytometry. A computational tool that could translate such data-sets into immediately applicable ligand design criteria may represent a potential avenue for the translation of our analyses into a more broadly applicable ligand engineering tool.
