## Discussion

<!-- Summary. -->

Here, we employ a multivalent binding model, which has been shown to accurately recapitulate complex binding phenomena, to explore the situational efficacy of various ligand engineering strategies. Selective targeting of specific cell populations to reduce off-target effects has long been of interest in the design of potent and non-toxic therapies. We use our multivalent model to elucidate guidelines for the engineering of ligands which selectively bind targeting of cellular populations according to their unique receptor profiles. We considered distinct engineering strategies, including modulation of receptor-ligand kinetics, ligand valency manipulation, mixtures of therapeutics, and bispecificity, as well as the potential synergies offered by employing these strategies simultaneously. The computational was analyses were performed on a family of theoretical cell populations uniquely defined by their expression of two receptors. 

We found that affinity engineering was most efficacious when target and off-target populations expressed different relative levels of the two receptor types, with greater discrepancies enhancing the benefits afforded by affinity engineering. When target and off-target populations express similar relative levels of receptors, and affinity engineering was rendered ineffective, we found that valency engineering offered a unique avenue for selective population targeting. The selectivity imparted through valency engineering was greatest when target and off target populations displayed receptors in great differences of magnitudes - the efficacy of valency engineering was also greatly interdependent on the kinetics of the receptor-ligand interactions, as the selectivity was imparted through a "velcro effect", where the rate of secondary binding interactions relative to the rate of unbinding is a key determinant of binding magnitude in multivalent binding. This rate is also highly dependent on receptor expression abundances on the populations of interest, creating an interplay between affinity, expression density, and ligand valency in the determination of optimal ligand characteristics. Mixtures of therapeutic ligands were found to be mostly innefective in imparting cell-type selectivity, and only demonstrated utility when binding to target populations was compared to binding events on multiple off-target populations. Using mathematical optimization, we found that in most cases, while a single ligand engineering strategy dominated in it's contributions to cell-type selectivity, in some cases synergies between these strategies exist and can be exploited to grant even greater degrees of binding selectivity.

<!-- A number of strategies are already employed. -->

A number of strategies identified are already observed in existing engineered therapies. For example, affinity changes in the cytokine IL-2 have been used to bias its effects towards either effector or regulatory immune populations [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1495; @pmid:30446251]. Varying the valency of tumor-targeted antibodies leads to targeted cell clearance based upon the levels of expressed antigen [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. Manipulation of the affinities of fibronectin domains displayed by octovalent nanorings was shown to enhance the selectivity of binding to cancerous cells displaying relatively higher densities of fibronectin receptors compared to native tissue [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. These examples lend support for the accuracy of our model. At the same time, recognizing these as separable strategies provides clearer guidance for future engineering.
