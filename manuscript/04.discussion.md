## Discussion

<!-- Summary. -->

Here, we developed and employed a multivalent, multi-ligand, multi-receptor binding model to explore the effectiveness of various ligand engineering strategies for population-selective binding (Fig. {@fig:model}). Using a representative set of theoretical cell populations defined by their distinct expression of two receptors, we examined the efficacy of several potential ligand engineering strategies, including changes to affinity, ligand valency, mixtures of species, multi-specificity, and these in combination.

Each strategyâ€™s contribution could be summarized by general patterns. We found that affinity changes were most effective when the target and off-target populations expressed distinct combinations receptors (Fig. {@fig:affinity}). Increasing the affinity of the receptors that are more abundantly expressed on the target cells, and decreasing those that are not, increased the binding selectivity, with greater differences in receptor patterns corresponding to greater benefits. When target and off-target populations had expressed an identical set of receptors, and only differed in receptor abundances, valency, but not affinity, changes were effective (Fig. {@fig:valency}). The efficacy of valency changes was greatly dependent on the kinetics of the receptor-ligand interactions and the difference in receptor abundance as the secondary binding and unbinding rates were a key determinant of ligand binding behavior. Mixtures of therapeutic ligands were found to be mostly ineffective in imparting binding selectivity, but had modest benefits with multiple off-target populations (Fig. {@fig:mixture}). Heterovalent bispecific ligands only showed unique advantages over mixtures of monovalent ligands or bivalent ligands when we restricted our binding quantity to be both subunits bound (Fig. {@fig:bispecific}). They prefer target populations that have high expression of both receptors over those with high expression of only a single receptor, with the preference for secondary binding as the key determinant for the magnitude of advancement. We found that, while a single ligand engineering strategy dominated in its contributions to cell type selectivity, synergies between these strategies existed in some cases to derive even greater specificity (Fig. {@fig:combination}). Finally, we found that combinations of monovalent therapeutic ligands with multivalent antagonistic ligands allowed improved selectivity for target populations expressing relatively fewer receptors to off-target populations.

<!-- No strategies for NOT relationships. -->

While the exploration of our multivalent binding model has elucidated strategies for selective targeting of many populations with respect to one or many off-target populations, several inter-population receptor expression relationships remain challenging to impart selectivity to. For example, target populations that unilaterally express fewer receptors of every type than off-target populations present a unique challenge for the design of a selective ligand. While we computationally show the potential for the simultaneous use of multivalent antagonistic ligands, which bind but do not induce a response, and monovalent agonists to exploit reduced receptor expression levels, the translation of such a therapeutic to a clinical application remains questionable (Fig. {@fig:combination} s-v). In cases where a target population expresses fewer receptors of any kind than an off-target population, our analysis suggests that other target receptors or therapeutic strategies should be considered. However, in cases where target populations express more of any type of receptor than an off-target population, we show that one or more of our formulated ligand engineering strategies can be employed to improve binding selectivity.

<!-- TODO: Mention more than two receptors, but should come below. -->

<!-- A number of strategies are already employed. -->

A number of strategies are already utilized in existing engineered therapies. For example, affinity changes in the cytokine IL-2 have been used to bias its effects towards either effector or regulatory immune populations [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1495; @pmid:30446251]. Varying the valency of tumor-targeted antibodies leads to targeted cell clearance based upon the levels of expressed antigen [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. Manipulation of the affinities of fibronectin domains displayed by octovalent nanorings was shown to enhance the selectivity of binding to cancerous cells displaying relatively higher densities of fibronectin receptors compared to native tissue [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. The advantages offered by therapeutics reliant on low-affinity, multivalent interactions to selectively bind cells with high receptor expression densities were also described in a study considering a therapeutic reliant on multivalent interactions between antibodies and therapeutic bound to receptors most prevalently expressed on tumor cells [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. These examples lend support to the accuracy of our model. At the same time, recognizing the previously described ligand engineering approaches as separable strategies provides clearer guidance for future engineering.

<!-- Still need to implement others. -->

Nonetheless, many optimization strategies described in this study have not been exploited in pharmaceutical practice yet, not because of the lack of consideration but due to the complexity of real biological contexts. First, some strategies are not practical biochemically. For example, the manipulation of ligand affinity requires intricate protein engineering. While the direction of affinity changes can be predicted, dictating the affinity is extremely difficult. Moreover, it is very likely altering the affinity of a ligand to a receptor of interest can change its affinity for other receptors, which may offset the intended benefit in improving selectivity. Potential dynamic changes in the receptor expression profile of a target population also complicate the matter. It is well documented that cancer cells can escape therapeutic targeting by upregulating [@doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2019.07.010; @doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0602] or downregulating [@pmid:14534734] certain receptors. In this case, not only should the abundance of receptors be considered, but also their variance within a cell population over time. The effects of expression change on the efficacy of a therapeutic are not evident without a mechanism-based analysis. Furthermore, while we explore the efficacy of combining monovalent agonists with multivalent antagonists for targeting cells expressing relatively fewer receptors to off-target populations, the complexity of engineering the affinities of both ligands makes effective implementation of the strategy much more difficult in practice. While this work does not intend to solve every aspect of these issues, we propose that using a computational binding model can analyze these strategies quantitatively and collectively from a mechanistic perspective. Even when the absolute mathematical optimum cannot be achieved biochemically, our analyses provide good guidance to what is attainable and how to approach the optimum, accounting those biological complexities and facilitating the implementation of complicated combinations of several strategies.

<!-- Impressive range of logic can be built without cells involved. -->

In many therapeutic applications where selective engagement of target cell populations is an important performance metric, such as the treatment of cancer, cellular engineering is becoming increasingly popular [@doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-042718-041407]. Human engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are being introduced in the clinical setting at a rapid rate, and advances in genetic engineering technologies have enhanced the potential of engineered immune cells to recognize and attack malignant tissues [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.06.012]. These technologies bypass ligand-receptor binding considerations by manipulating the complexities of the immune system to attack cells expressing particular receptors. However, manipulations of the immune system inevitably lead to myriad unintended effects due to the complex regulatory mechanisms which control immune activation and activity. We have shown here that complex and targeted changes to the binding activity of simple therapeutic ligands can be achieved via relatively simple ligand characteristic manipulation. This study lays the framework for how protein engineering specifications can be defined using computational modeling. It should be noted that the application of this logic is reliant on knowledge of the target and off-target cell population receptor expression levels. Future application of the ligand binding logic described in this study could be guided using high throughputs single-cell profiling techniques, such as RNA-seq or high-parameter flow cytometry. A computational tool that could translate such data-sets into immediately applicable ligand design criteria may represent a potential avenue for the translation of our analyses into a more broadly applicable ligand engineering tool.
