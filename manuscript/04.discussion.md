<!-- A number of strategies are already employed. -->

A number of strategies identified are already observed in existing engineered therapies. For example, affinity changes in the cytokine IL-2 have been used to bias its effects towards either effector or regulatory immune populations [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1495; @pmid:30446251]. Varying the valency of tumor-targeted antibodies leads to targeted cell clearance based upon the levels of expressed antigen [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. These examples lend support for the accuracy of our model. At the same time, recognizing these as separable strategies provides clearer guidance for future engineering.
