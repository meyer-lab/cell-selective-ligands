## Discussion

<!-- Summary. -->

Here, we developed and employed a multivalent, multi-ligand, multi-receptor binding model and used it to explore the effectiveness of various ligand engineering strategies for population-selective binding (Fig. {@fig:model}). Using a representative set of theoretical cell populations defined by their distinct expression of two receptors, we examined the efficacy of several potential ligand engineering strategies, including changes to affinity, ligand valency, mixtures of species, multi-specificity, antagonist competition, and these in combination.

Each strategy’s contribution can be summarized by general patterns. We found that affinity changes were most effective when the target and off-target populations expressed distinct combinations of receptors (Fig. {@fig:affinity}). Binding selectivity was enhanced by increasing the affinity of the ligand for those receptors that are more abundantly expressed on the target cells and decreasing its affinity for those that are not. Selectivity depended upon large differences in receptor expression levels between on- and off-target populations. When target and off-target populations expressed the same pattern of receptors and only differed in receptor abundances, modulations in valency, but not affinity, were effective (Fig. {@fig:valency}). A key determinant of valency’s effectiveness was the secondary binding and unbinding rate which is dependent on both the kinetics of the receptor-ligand interaction and receptor abundance. Ligand mixtures were mostly ineffective for imparting binding selectivity, and only had modest benefits when considering two or more off-target populations (Fig. {@fig:mixture}). Heterovalent bispecific ligands only showed unique advantages over mixtures of monovalent ligands or bivalent ligands when solely considering fully bound ligand (Fig. {@fig:bispecific}). These ligands exhibit preferential binding to target populations that have high expression of both receptors over those with high expression of only a single receptor, with the propensity for secondary binding acting as a key determinant for selectivity. We found that, while a single ligand engineering strategy dominated in its contributions to cell type selectivity, synergies between these strategies existed in some cases to derive even greater specificity (Fig. {@fig:combination}). Finally, we found that combinations of monovalent therapeutic ligands with multivalent antagonistic ligands allow for the unique selection of target populations expressing relatively fewer receptors than off-target populations (Fig. {@fig:deadLig}).

While we have used our model to elucidate generally applicable guidelines for the engineering of more specific ligands, it is important to note that the model relies on a host of assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions may challenge the applicability of our model to other biological scenarios. For example, our model assumes that receptors are uniformly distributed on the surface of the cell, and that no pre-association or colocalization of receptors occurs. While the effects of receptor colocalization may be captured to some degree by the $K_x^*$ parameter which our model utilizes, it is not explicitly accounted for by our approach. Our model also assumes that no ligand depletion occurs, a condition which may be inaccurate at low ligand doses and may be more accurately modeled using a dynamical model as opposed to our equilibrium model. However, in both of these cases, the absolute and relative abundances of available receptors still play a governing role in determining cell type-selectivity of ligand binding; thus, we believe our model's findings remain pertinent in most selectivity engineering efforts.

<!-- No strategies for NOT relationships. -->

While our multivalent binding model identified strategies for selective targeting in many cases, it also identified situations for which selective binding is challenging. For example, selectively targeting populations based on their absence of receptor expression remains challenging. While we computationally show the potential of using multivalent antagonists with monovalent agonists to selectively target such populations, implementing this may be challenging in practice. In cases where a target population expresses fewer receptors of any kind than an off-target population, our analysis suggests that targeting other receptors should be considered. However, in cases where target populations express more of any type of receptor than an off-target population, we show that one or more of our formulated ligand engineering strategies can be employed to improve binding selectivity. While we expect the same patterns to apply with greater than two receptors, certain emergent behaviors may exist with tri-specific and more complex ligand binding.

<!-- A number of strategies are already employed. -->

A few of the strategies that we explored have been utilized in existing engineered therapies. For example, affinity changes to the cytokine IL-2 have been used to bias its effects towards either effector or regulatory immune populations [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-18-1495; @pmid:30446251]. Varying the valency of tumor-targeted antibodies leads to selective cell clearance based upon the levels of expressed antigen [@doi:10.1038/srep40098]. Manipulating of the affinities of the fibronectin domains on octovalent nanorings was shown to enhance the selectivity of binding to cancerous cells displaying relatively higher densities of fibronectin receptors compared to native tissue [@doi:10.1021/jacs.8b09198]. The tendency of low-affinity, multivalent interactions to target cells expressing high receptor abundances was also described in a study describing the selectivity of multivalent antibody binding to tumor cells bound by a bispecific therapeutic ligand [@doi:10.1021/cb6003788]. These examples lend support to the accuracy and translational value of our model. At the same time, recognizing these previously described ligand engineering approaches as separable strategies provides clearer guidance for future engineering.

<!-- Still need to implement others. -->

Some of the optimization strategies described here have not been exploited in part due to the complexity of real biological applications. First, some strategies may not be biochemically practical. For example, the manipulating ligand affinity requires intricate protein engineering. Potential dynamic changes in the receptor expression profile of a target population also complicate the matter. It is well documented that cancer cells can escape therapeutic targeting by upregulating [@doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2019.07.010; @doi:10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-0602] or downregulating [@pmid:14534734] the expression of certain receptors. In this case, both the current and potential abundance of each receptor must be considered. While this work does not address many of these issues, we propose that using a computational binding model can analyze these strategies quantitatively and collectively from a mechanistic perspective. Even when the absolute mathematically optimal ligand characteristics cannot be achieved biochemically, our analyses provide guidance within the bounds of what is attainable and how to approach the optimum, accounting for implementation feasibility and facilitating the implementation of strategy combinations.

<!-- Impressive range of logic can be built without cells involved. -->

In many therapeutic applications where selective engagement of target cell populations is an important performance metric, such as the treatment of cancer, cellular therapies are becoming increasingly popular [@doi:10.1146/annurev-immunol-042718-041407]. Human engineered chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have enhanced the potential to selectively recognize and attack malignant tissues [@doi:10.1016/j.ymthe.2017.06.012]. These technologies bypass ligand-receptor binding restrictions by allowing recognition in signaling response. However, we have shown here that selectivity can often be attained with relatively simple therapeutic ligands. This study lays the framework for how ligand engineering can be directed using computational modeling. It should be noted that the application of this logic is reliant on knowledge of the target and off-target cell population receptor expression levels. Future application of the ligand binding logic described in this study could be guided using high-throughput single-cell profiling techniques, such as RNA-seq or high-parameter flow cytometry. A computational tool that could directly translate such datasets into ligand design criteria, selecting among potential receptor targets, may represent a potential avenue for the translation of our analyses into a more broadly applicable ligand engineering tool.
