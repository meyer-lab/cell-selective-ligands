![**Model is able to recapitulate experimental multivalent binding activity.** a) Experimental vs. predicted fluorescent units for MCF-7 cells expressing $3.8x$10^{6}$  fibronectin receptors $\mathrm{cell}$ bound to nanorings expressing one, two, four or eight fibronectin binding domains at  concentrations ranging from 1.6 $10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$ to 5 $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$. C5 and B22 are high and low affinity fibronectin binding domains respectively. Using a least-squares regression, the crosslinking coeffient was found to be 1.11 $10^{-12}$, the association constants for C5 and B22 were found to be 5.78 $10^{-5}$, 3.08 $10^{-12}$ respectively, and ligand to fluorescent conversion factor for C5 and B22 were found to be 5.0 $10^{-2}$ and 3.2 $10^{-2}$ respectively. b) Predicted fluorescent values for cells expressing MDA cells expressing $5.2x$10^{4}$  receptors $\mathrm{cell}$, SK cells expressing $2.2x$10^{5}$  receptors $\mathrm{cell}$, LNCaP cells expressing $2.8x$10^{6}$  receptors $\mathrm{cell}$, and MCF-7 cells expressing  $3.8x$10^{6}$  receptors $\mathrm{cell}$ as described in Csizmar et al.. Fluorescence was predicted for interactions with octa- and tetravalent ligands expressing either C5 or B22 fibronecting binding domains. c) Predicted binding ratios of MCF-7 cells to MDA cells when bound with octa- and tetravalent ligands expressing either C5 or B22 fibronecting binding domains.](figureS1.svg){#fig:Csizmar}
