![**Model is able to recapitulate experimental multivalent binding activity.** a) Experimental vs. predicted fluorescent units for MCF-7 cells expressing $3.8x10^{6}$ fibronectin receptors per cell bound to nanorings expressing one, two, four or eight fibronectin binding domains at concentrations of 0.16â€“500 nM. C5 and B22 are high and low affinity fibronectin binding domains respectively. Using nonlinear least-squares regression, the crosslinking coeffient was found to be $1.11x10^{-12}$, the association constants for C5 and B22 were found to be $5.78x10^{-5}$, $3.08x10^{-12}$ respectively, and ligand to fluorescent conversion factor for C5 and B22 were found to be $5.0x10^{-2}$ and $3.2x10^{-2}$ respectively. b) Predicted fluorescent values for MDA cells expressing $5.2x10^{4}$, SK cells expressing $2.2x$10^{5}$, LNCaP cells expressing $2.8x10^{6}$, and MCF-7 cells expressing $3.8x10^{6}$ receptors per cell as described in Csizmar et al.. Fluorescence was predicted for interactions with octa- and tetravalent ligands expressing either C5 or B22 fibronecting binding domains. c) Predicted binding ratios of MCF-7 cells to MDA cells when bound with octa- and tetravalent ligands expressing either C5 or B22 fibronecting binding domains.](figureS1.svg){#fig:Csizmar}
